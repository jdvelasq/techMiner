Researchers report a lack of adoption and ineffective utilisation of digital technologies in smaller tourism businesses. The study focuses on two university-facilitated projects of digital marketing adoption and utilisation by 53 small and medium sized tourism businesses in the South of England. The framework for this study was driven by Modes of Knowledge Transference and Technology-In-Practice. The findings describe peer-to-peer knowledge acquisition and sharing that take place in university-led projects and suggests that a combination of Mode 1 and Mode 2 knowledge helps entrepreneurs to advance their digital marketing knowledge. Peer-to-peer clusters are an effective means of placing digital marketing knowledge and technology in the context of small and medium tourism business practice. The paper provides implications for destination marketing organisations and policymakers and suggestions for future avenues of research are offered. © 2020,Digital marketing; Entrepreneur; Knowledge acquisition; Mode 1 and Mode 2 knowledge; Small tourism businesses; Technology-in-practice,business development; future prospect; tourism development; tourism economics; tourism management; tourism market; England; United Kingdom,"Alford, P.; Southampton Business School, University of Southampton, Building 2, Highfield Campus, United Kingdom; email: P.R.Alford@soton.ac.uk",,Elsevier Ltd,2615177,,,,English,Tour.

The purpose of this study is to identify the factors that would help the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) of India to adopt Social Media Marketing (SMM) mechanisms for improving their business impact. Adoption of SMM by SMEs has considerable impact on the improvement of business outcome of the SMEs. A theoretical model has been developed with the help of theory borrowed from TAM and UTAUT2 with some modifications to explore this impact through business performance, sales, connect with customers, identify customer' needs and creativity of the employees. The theoretical model has been validated empirically using a survey of 310 firms and subsequent analysis have been carried out using structured equation modelling. The results highlight that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and compatibility positively affect impact of SMM after adoption by the SMEs. The facilitating conditions have insignificant impact whereas cost has a significant but negative impact on the use of SMM by SMEs. Since there are a few studies in this context, the study contributes to existing literature on the impact of SMM in SMEs in an emerging economy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Digital marketing; Small and medium enterprises; Social media impact; Social media marketing; Technology impact,Commerce; Sales; Social networking (online); Digital marketing; Small and medium enterprise; Social media; Social media marketings; Technology impact; Economic and social effects,"Kumar Kar, A.; Department of Management Studies, Indian Institute of Technology DelhiIndia; email: arpan_kar@yahoo.co.in",,Elsevier Ltd,2684012,,IJMAE,,English,Int J Inf Manage,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081129873,3

The study of information flows allows using a comprehensive approach to the problems of online marketing. The activities of small businesses are characterized by various limitations, but it is an important factor in increasing the flexibility of the economy and the ability to adapt to changes. The gap in the theory and practice of conducting Internet marketing activity in micro enterprises has helped to shape the relevance of this work. The aim of the study is to research the phenomenon of visibility of Internet websites from the perspective of marketing information flows in the activities of small businesses. The article discusses the theoretical foundations of marketing information flows, Internet marketing, inbound marketing and visibility of Internet websites. The research methodology is based on the methods of marketing analysis and sociological surveys. The study was conducted on the basis of the sampling of 306 websites of small enterprises. The study examined the characteristics of the websites of small enterprises, reflecting the effectiveness of Internet marketing activities. The results show that there is a correlation between the number of applied methods of Internet marketing and the visibility of the websites of small organizations in the search engine. The existence of particular cases of the use of single methods of Internet marketing has been revealed, providing high visibility and effectiveness of Internet marketing activities of small organizations. © 2020 Artoym Kovalenko et al., published by Sciendo.",internet marketing technologies; marketing flows; micro-enterprises; online marketing; search engines; visibility,,,,Sciendo,18420206,,,,English,Manage.

We review the size, structure, and strategies of both the U.S. national and global alcohol industries and their principal marketing activities and expenditures and provide a summary of public health responses. METHOD: Primary data were obtained from advertising and alcohol industry market research firms and were supplemented by searches of peer-reviewed literature, business press, and online databases on global business and trade. RESULTS: Worldwide, alcohol sales totaled more than $1.5 trillion in 2017. Control of alcoholic beverage production and marketing is concentrated globally in the hands of a small number of firms. The oligopoly structure of the producing industry helps to generate high profits per dollar invested relative to other industries, which in turn fund marketing expenditures that function as barriers to entry by other firms. Advertising expenditures are high and advertising is widespread. Stakeholder marketing and corporate social responsibility campaigns assist in maintaining a policy environment conducive to extensive alcohol marketing activity. The most common regulatory response has been alcohol industry self-regulation; statutory public health responses have made little progress in recent years and have lagged behind industry innovation in digital and social marketing. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol marketing is widespread globally and a structural element of the alcoholic beverage industry. Given the level of alcohol-related harm worldwide, global and regional recommendations and best practices should be used to guide policy makers in effective regulation of alcohol marketing.",,,,,NLM (Medline),19465858,,,32079559,English,J Stud Alcohol Drugs Suppl,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079759861,1

Design/methodology/approach: A number of Swiss associations provided their databases for an online survey. The large sample includes 2,590 participants from 1,854 organisations and delivered over 4,200 descriptions of DT, categorised into seven SAFs. A cross tabulation of SAF combinations by firm size identified 127 possible SAF combinations which constitute the common understanding of DT. Findings: The data set allowed the identification of SAFs and the conceptualisation of DT based on a shared understanding. Drivers of digital transformation are: process engineering, new technologies and digital business development, supported by digital leadership and culture, the cloud and data, customer centricity and digital marketing. Research limitations/implications: For practitioners, the study provides the SAFs that should be considered for DT strategies. For academic scholars, a unique data set has allowed the study of DT by analysing action field combinations, revealing a nuanced constellation of SAFs. Limitations are the focus on Swiss organisations and a convenience sample for collecting the analysed data.

The purpose of this paper is twofold: (1) to offer a conceptualization of DMCs from a relational dynamic capabilities perspective and (2) to explore performance outcomes of DMCs for international firms, taking into account firm size and entrepreneurial orientation. Design/methodology/approach: A survey on a sample of 167 international firms is used and analyzed using hierarchical regression. Findings: DMCs contribute positively to performance. Firms with greater entrepreneurial orientation leverage DMCs more effectively and have better performance. Small firms with strong digital capabilities perform as well as medium-sized firms. Large firms perform marginally better than small and medium-sized firms. Research limitations/implications: This paper complements previous IB studies that only study customer-related or supplier- and channel-related IT adoption. It is based on a more holistic conceptualization of DMCs, and draws on market sensing, customer-linking, customer retention, supplier relationship and channel bonding capabilities. It offers new empirical evidence for the positive impact of DMCs on firm performance. It also contributes to small and medium-sized enterprise and digital entrepreneurship literature by comparing the performance outcomes of DMCs for different size firms with varying degrees of entrepreneurial orientation. Practical implications: This study provides implementable measures of DMCs. The findings encourage firms to develop entrepreneurial orientation alongside DMCs. Originality/value: This paper presents DMCs as relational dynamic capabilities and shows the moderating effect of entrepreneurial orientation and firm size on the DMCs–performance relationship. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Digital marketing; Dynamic capabilities; Entrepreneurial orientation; International business; SMEs,,"Wang, F.; King's Business School, King's College LondonUnited Kingdom; email: fatima.wang@kcl.ac.uk",,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,2651335,,,,English,Int.

A detailed literature review revealed that the HMR market in Korea is close to saturation. Notably, the technologically advanced products produced using sous-vide seem to display significant potential to overcome market saturation. The sous-vide method differs from conventional cooking techniques and is characterized by maintenance of food texture along with flavor enhancement. However, due to the unfamiliarity of the manufacturers with this method and the unclear food safety regulations, mass food manufacturing companies do not agree on using this method; hence, sous-vide production is usually undertaken by small/medium sized companies catering primarily through online marketing portals.

The development of this business is inseparable from the times. A few years ago SMEs in the promotion strategy and sales strategy were still offline and their marketing strategy still used advertisements and brochures while in the sales process, they still used the business location or shop as a place for meetings between traders and sellers. Current use patterns need to change to incorporate digitization and a digital marketing strategy is needed which utilizes websites, blogs or social media as a means of promotion and consequently sales strategy must utilize websites, social media, chat applications or e-commerce. However, there are still many SME business people who do not use digital marketing as their business strategy. This is due to their ignorance of how to use digital marketing in the sales process. Therefore the aim of this research is to create a digital marketing training model for SMEs which will be used in business development. Based on the results and discussion, the impact of the training is that MSME entrepreneurs will be able to carry out digital marketing in their business, such as promotions using websites, chat applications or by using social media and in context of the sales process, can use a website, chat application, social media or e-commerce. To facilitate digital marketing training, it is necessary to determine SME awareness and access to information about digital marketing.

The authors explored the relationship between firm competitiveness and firm characteristics such as size, age, industry affiliation and location. Design/methodology/approach: The complex competitiveness index as a proxy for firm competitiveness was calculated from the survey data. In total, 132 complete questionnaires filled in by representatives of randomly selected Czech SMEs were collected in 2018. Additional firm characteristics (size, age, industry affiliation and location) considered as determinants of competitiveness were obtained from the commercial database Albertina and from the Czech Statistical Office. The determinants of competitiveness were tested econometrically by estimation of multivariate regression models. Findings: The authors mainly found a significant relationship between the firm size and competitiveness of the Czech SMEs. The authors have also confirmed that the least competitive enterprises are those operating in the agricultural sector and that regional location plays an important role in the determination of firm competitiveness. Practical implications: The identification of competitiveness drivers can provide entrepreneurs, managers and policymakers with important implications. It seems beneficial for the Czech SMEs to expand the scope of operations to achieve a larger company size, for example, by focussing on investment activities, direct marketing, improving entrepreneurial skills or by applying an aggressive sales strategy, especially towards markets with lower competition. Politicians may respond to these efforts by setting the appropriate policies that promote SMEs’ competitiveness, for example, through the hard and soft public support for financial and human resources. Originality/value: Although many studies on competitiveness have been published, there is still a limited number of firm-level studies looking at competitiveness from multiple angles rather than from the study of profitability and productivity. In contrast, the study uses a complex firm-level competitiveness index based on ten competitiveness pillars (technology, human capital, products, domestic market, networks, international markets, online presence, marketing, decision making and strategy) to capture the contribution of different resources and capabilities to firm competitiveness. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Competitiveness; Competitiveness index; Czech Republic; Firm size; Firm-level analysis; Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs),,"Dvouletý, O.; Department of Entrepreneurship, University of EconomicsCzech Republic; email: ondrej.dvoulety@vse.cz",,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,10595422,,,,English,Compet.

The purpose of this study was to identify and understand the relevance and importance of growth hacking and identify what growth hacking tools and techniques are used by such organisations. Design/methodology/approach: The main research method for the collection of primary data was in-depth interviews with both industry experts (senior professionals working for growth hacking agencies) and individual growth hacking practitioners who work for technology start-ups based in the UK. Interviews included the use of dimension cards with key growth hacking terms to act as visual cues to facilitate focus and prompt reflection. Findings: In addition to a data analysis element, growth hacking also requires people to spot emerging opportunities before anyone else does. This makes it very difficult to find people with the right skill-set. It is also important to use traditional marketing methods to bridge the gap between the physical and digital world. Originality/value: This study shows that growth hacking is a mind-set and process that can help technology start-ups grow quickly with a limited marketing budget. The research offers guidelines and frameworks for start-ups to understand the growth hacking process. The concept has direct synergy with agile marketing and this might be a term/ methodology with which people in the UK may feel more comfortable given the negative connotations of the word “hacking”. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Agile marketing; Entrepreneurial marketing; Growth hacking; Small firms; Technology led strategy; Technology start-ups,,"Conway, T.; Department of Marketing, Retail and Tourism, Manchester Metropolitan UniversityUnited Kingdom; email: t.conway@mmu.ac.uk",,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,14715201,,,,English,J.

Agencies may have experienced professionals or workload to perform these jobs, but the costs are greater. This paper aims to investigate the effects of investments in digital marketing on the financial outcome of a company’s services, comparing whether or not it is outsourced to advertising agencies. The secondary data relates to services advertised and marketed by a firm. We tested the possible moderating effect of outsourcing the service in the relationship between investment in online advertising (Google and Facebook) and return on sales (profit margin), by controlling the effect of covariates. Through four regression analyses, the results showed that outsourcing the service moderates the relationship. Specifically, the higher the amount of advertising investment, the more it pays to outsource the service to an advertising agency in order to generate greater profit margin. But with a low investment value, it does not pay to outsource. This study helps to identify situations in which it pays to outsource digital marketing services to an advertising agency. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",advertising agency; Digital marketing; financial performance; investment; outsourcing; small enterprise,,"Porto, R.B.; Postgraduate Program in Business Management, University of Brasília, Campus Universitário Darcy RibeiroBrazil; email: rafaelporto@unb.br",,Routledge,13527266,,,,English,J.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors content-analyzed social media activity and interviews with 14 managers of social media in small independent restaurants in the northeast region of the USA that employed fewer than 20 employees. Findings: The results of the study show that most small restaurants can be classified as anarchic, hierarchical and conservative defenders, and that they mainly focus on promotional activities on social media. The majority use social media also to drive traffic to a restaurant and, thus, act as calculative pragmatists. Very few use social media strategically or creatively in any of the social media management stages, and very few monitor or use social media information to improve their operations. Research limitations/implications: This study shows that the adopted theoretical framework in this study for social media management helps analyze social media operations in small restaurants, points to the strategic orientations applied in small restaurants, shows the intricacies of each stage and helps show what small restaurants do well and how they can improve. Future research may use larger samples, investigate frameworks particularly relevant to small restaurants, such as the resource-based view (RBV) framework, and may focus on creative and diverse strategic approaches toward social media management for small establishments. Practical implications: As customers continue shifting to social media and review sites, more restaurants may want to invest in developing more creative approaches toward social media and do it in more structured, integrated and continuous ways. The study describes a process they may want to follow and specific tactics that could be implemented to use social media more strategically in all stages of social media management. Social implications: Not only are small business establishments the backbone of the restaurant industry, but they also appeal to customers more than large chains. This study shows how these small businesses can utilize social media to attract more customers, engage them, learn about them and their competitive environment to market and improve their operations. Originality/value: The authors focus on the supplier side of social media for restaurants, a perspective lacking in the literature, and specifically small restaurants that receive less attention in prior research. Few studies exist that explore how social media is incorporated in all stages of social media management. The study points to the unique challenges that small restaurants experience in the process of using social media for marketing, monitoring and using social media to improve their operations. The study uses a relatively large sample of qualitative interviews conducted with managers of small restaurants and a content analysis of their actual social media activity. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Online marketing; Small business; Small media management; Small restaurants; Social media,business; hierarchical system; marketing; media role; small scale industry; social media; World Wide Web; United States,"Lepkowska-White, E.; Department of Management and Business, Skidmore CollegeUnited States; email: elepkows@skidmore.edu",,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,17506182,,,,English,Int.

Second, demonstrate that companies work with limited resources, typically and notably newly established companies, and that these resources should be allocated according to a carefully determined strategy. The resources focussed on in this case pertain to marketing. Third, examine entrepreneurial marketing and its various manifestations. An understanding of how this type of marketing is used by companies for international expansion is expected. Fourth, assess the role of digital marketing and how social media forms an important part of digital marketing. Particular attention is paid to the use of digital marketing, notably social media, in international expansion. Fifth, develop critical thinking skills with respect to strategic business decisions, such as whether to expand a business into foreign markets or to consolidate locally; and how best to penetrate foreign markets, given the nuances and complexities specific to these markets. Case overview/synopsis: This teaching case is about The Duchess, a recently developed and launched virgin alcohol-free and sugar-free gin and tonic beverage. The adult soft drink was originally launched in South Africa, and just 18 months later became available in international markets (the UK and Belgium). The founders and protagonists of the case, Johannes le Roux and Inus Smuts, face the dilemmas of creating a competitive local brand while also looking to access new markets and internationalise as a born-global firm.

Given the scant empirical evaluation of social media use in the small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) business-to-business (B-to-B) context, this paper aims to offer a comprehensive description of the antecedents and consequences of social media use in international B-to-B SMEs and the way in which this use affects their export performance. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a sample of 277 British B-to-B SMEs and uses positivist research with a quantitative approach, adopting a survey strategy through questionnaires and structural equation modeling. Findings: The results reveal that the use of social media influences export performance through the quality of international business contacts – understanding customers’ views and preferences, brand awareness and knowledge of the competition in various international markets. This study contributes to the emerging literature on B-to-B SMEs digital marketing by determining the mechanism through which B-to-B SMEs may benefit from using the social media in their efforts to export. Originality/value: Despite the promising potential of the social media, especially for export-oriented companies, very limited attention has hitherto been paid to the relationship between the use of social media and export performance. This study attempts to fill the gap by investigating the extent to which actual use of social media impacts on the performance of exporting firms. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",B-to-B; Export Performance; SMEs; Social media marketing; Structural equation modeling (SEM),,"Eid, R.; United Arab Emirates UniversityUnited Arab Emirates; email: riyad.aly@uaeu.ac.ae",,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,8858624,,,,English,J.

Many Japanese SMEs are risk-averse in adopting technological innovation such as the Internet. Others, despite these risk-related business norms, recognize the importance of technology and develop and deploy Internet marketing technology to compete in the current competitive environment. Drawing upon these contradicting practices among Japanese SMEs, this study investigates how Japanese SMEs risk perception impacts on the deployment of Internet marketing capabilities, the relationships between perception of risk, international mind-set, business networks, Internet marketing capabilities, and firm performance. This study makes two contributions. Firstly, there has been limited research investigating how Internet-related capabilities impact on firms’ performance. Secondly, there are few Internet-related studies in Japan. Thus, our emphasis on key antecedents and outcomes of Internet marketing capabilities among Japanese SMEs contributes significantly to our understanding of this unique contextual setting. The findings also provide some insights to managers/owners of Japanese SMEs that lower risk perception fosters adoption of the Internet and combined with other resources creates Internet marketing capabilities which results in higher performance. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",international mind-set; Internet marketing capabilities; risk perception,,"Mathews, S.W.; School of Business, Queensland University of TechnologyAustralia; email: sw.mathews@qut.edu.au",,Routledge,0965254X,,,,English,J.

Design/methodology/approach: This research is designed using qualitative method. The research is directed more toward a research with phenomenological approach because the research also gives the description related to the phenomena in the field to the actor of SMEs and Disperdagin of Surabaya City. The researcher picks Surabaya City as the location by considering the following: the number of SMEs in the Surabaya city is greater than any other cities in East Java considering that Surabaya is the capital of East Java. The number of SMEs is 37,906 units; it means that Surabaya is a city with high economic activity and this place is also the largest trading city after Jakarta. Based on the number of SMEs mentioned above, in this research, only leading SMEs are taken amounted to 161 leading SMEs in the Surabaya City. Information or technological exchange and development are faster compared to other cities because most of the community living in this city uses information technology in running their business. Findings: SME actors in Surabaya city have high interest in using m-commerce. In expanding the network, the SME actors use online media. The SME actors in Surabaya have successfully expanded the business network through online marketing by using m-commerce to overseas including Germany, France, South Korea and the UK. Effective model is needed for the policy in Surabaya city is Disperdagin has its own website to overshadow all SMEs in Surabaya City, and identify the role of Disperdagin to SME or vice versa, and clustering SMEs in Surabaya such as cluster of handicraft and Food and Beverage (MAMIN). Factors that are the advantages of using m-commerce are wider business network; increasing sales; adding resellers and buyers; smooth business transaction; development of product innovation, process and marketing; the facilities provided by the government; and easy to use m-commerce application. Originality/value: This is one of few papers that study the interest of SMEs actor in using mobile commerce in effort to expand business network. The use of m-commerce will grow the business capability of SMEs, thus increasing the role of SMEs as the counterweight to the structure of the national economy. Therefore, the government policy related to the use of e-commerce and m-commerce is very important to be socialized to business actors, especially the SMEs. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Expand business network; Interest of SMEs actor; Mobile commerce,,"Siti Astuti, E.; Faculty of Administrative Sciences, Brawijaya UniversityIndonesia; email: endang.ub.jp@gmail.com",,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,20534620,,,,English,J.

This study evaluates the entrance of small domestic tourism business owners into Israeli Facebook groups, analyzing their consumer engagement tactics using virtual ethnography (netnography) as a research method. Netnography is a qualitative approach to data collection in virtual communities. In this research, the procedure was multistep: observation, qualitative data collection of closed and open tourism Facebook groups, and analysis and presentation of results as well as their implications. Key findings indicate that SME marketing efforts mimic organic user activities, exploiting virtual characteristics on Facebook groups (e.g. a sense of community, belonging, and trust). Another notable phenomenon is the undisclosed marketing communication tool kit employed to transmit message. It includes tactics such as separation of private and business profiles, exploitation of family relations, and repeat recommendations.

Such companies have introduced their business over social media in order to gain greater attention from the consumers. However, the major concern addressed regarding how products and services are promoted online is regarding sustainable marketing. It is explored that most of the consumers tend to view online businesses by visualizing essential factors that reflect sustainability and thus, SMEs have started to analyze specific web atmospheric cues, which contribute in developing social media according to consumer behavior and their perceptions. To assess the research area, the following study is performed to understand possible measures that are significant in bridging business and consumer needs.

The characteristics of new media have many similarities with tourism marketing, which conforms to the characteristics of destination marketing’s target market. Using the new media to perform marketing and increase the coverage of information is notably low-cost, enhances interactions, enables more convenient communications, and improves the efficiency of marketing. However, there are risks in the new media marketing, and there are certain limitations in certain aspects. To successfully use this double-edged sword to promote the overall promotion of tourism destination marketing, it is necessary to summarize the exploration and practice of new media on tourist destinations, introduce advanced marketing concepts, such as integrated marketing, relationship marketing, viral marketing and event marketing, and propose a set of effective new media marketing operations, methods and strategies. This paper studies the key success factors of tourist destinations. First, according to the nature of new media in tourist destination, the new media recognition standard for the tourist destination is proposed. Second, using the Delphi method and the system evaluation method, a new media related success factor identification scheme is established to foster the core of new media training in the tourist destination. These abilities provide relevant suggestions. © 2019, ICIC International.

Methods: Four ECIG liquid retailers from four U.S. geographic regions (n = 16) were randomly selected. Menthol, apple, and tobacco flavored liquids were purchased in April of 2016 (n = 144, 48 unique flavors). Staff analyzed the text and image descriptors displayed on liquid bottles and retailer websites and coded content for presence of specific flavor, taste/smell, chemesthesis (i.e., touch), America/patriotic, and product quality/potentially modified risk content. A follow-up of retailer websites was conducted in March 2018. Results: Nearly all (97.9%) ECIG liquids included a description that promoted flavor. Most descriptions including images of something other than an ECIG liquid bottle (e.g., 62% of tobacco ECIG liquid images included dried tobacco leaves, 43% of menthol ECIG liquid images included mint leaves or ice, 62% of apple ECIG liquid images included an apple). Images often promoted product sensations (e.g., cool, ice), sweet tastes of other products (e.g., chocolate, apple pie), or other appeals (e.g., America). Menthol and apple descriptions/images were more likely than tobacco descriptions/images to promote appeals related to chemesthesis (e.g., cool, warm, moist; p <.05). Most flavors were still available in 2018 and included the same flavor descriptions from 2016. Conclusions: Flavored ECIG liquid marketing often includes text descriptions and images that appeal to consumer sensations. Studies are needed to examine how access to point-of-sale Internet advertisements influences attitudes, perceptions, and purchasing of ECIG products, especially among at-risk populations such as youth. © 2018",Electronic cigarettes; Flavors; Internet; Liquid; Marketing; Promotion,menthol; flavoring agent; apple; Article; chocolate; content analysis; flavor; Internet; liquid; marketing; odor; online system; plant leaf; taste; tobacco; touch; Western Hemisphere; advertising; electronic cigarette; human; packaging; vaping; Advertising; Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems; Flavoring Agents; Humans; Internet; Marketing; Product Packaging; Vaping,"Soule, E.K.; Department of Health Education and Promotion, East Carolina University, Carol Belk Building, United States; email: soulee18@ecu.edu",,Elsevier Ltd,3064603,,ADBED,30606627,English,Addict.

More specifically, variables on using digital marketing channels were derived such as ‘trust in SNS product information’ and ‘sharing of SNS product information’; independent variables were set such as ‘purchase of innovative goods’ related to innovative propensity of individuals, and ‘focus on comparative search and rational decision’ and ‘focus on shopping trends and styles’ as consumer personality variables. The effects of these variables on the subordinate variable ‘decision to purchase small business products’ were examined by regression. The research subjects were 500 men and women aged 20-59 years living in Seoul, Korea and five metropolitan cities (Busan, Daegu, Daejeon, Gwangju and Incheon). The findings of this study indicate that consumers’ higher trust in and higher sharing of SNS product information increase the purchase of SME products, and that consumers’ purchase of innovative goods also positively affects their selection of small business products. It was revealed that the experience of small business products using digital marketing channels such as online, mobile and social media and the marketing communication activities of consumer participation have significant influences on the selection of small business products. © Rushing Water Publishers Ltd. 2019.",Digital channels; Digital marketing; Selection strategy of small business products; Sharing of SNS information; Social Network Service (SNS); Trust in SNS information,,"Jung, H.-K.; Department of New Media, Seoul Media Institute of Technology (SMIT), 99 Hwagok-ro 61-gil, Gangseo-gu, South Korea; email: hkjung@smit.ac.kr",,Rushing Water Publishers Ltd.,1173375,,,,English,Asia Life Sci.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062653872,3

The purpose of this multiple case study was to explore the marketing strategies used by owners of small businesses to maintain their organization through the initial 5 years of operation. Methods: The population included 5 physical therapy business owners in northeastern Florida. The conceptual framework for this study was the brand equity model, and data were collected through semistructured interviews, online company marketing materials, and archival company documents. Yin’s 5-step analysis guided the data analysis process. Member checking, transcript review, and triangulation were used to validate the study data. Results: The participants validated marketing strategies consistent with Aaker’s [18] brand equity model and review of the literature. The findings showed that small business owners used brand awareness, relationship marketing, perceived quality, online marketing, and WOM marketing. Conclusion: The results of this study align with the evidence in the current literature. Owners who use marketing strategies to sustain their business are more likely to be successful. Small business owners who utilize word-of-mouth, brand awareness, perceived quality, and relationship marketing with their customers can ultimately sustain their businesses. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",brand equity; Marketing; physical therapy; small business; social media,,"Daugherty, M.L.; Walden UniversityUnited States; email: mdaugherty@usa.edu",,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,20479700,,,,English,Int.

Some of the components of the conceptual framework include after-sale services, e-marketing budget, tools for online marketing, e-promotions aimed at improving marketing performance and usefulness of marketing. Design: The researcher developed and tested four hypotheses related to different aspects of the e-market business model. Testing of measures' authenticity and hypothesis is usually essential. For accurate testing of both, confirmatory factor analysis and structured equations used respectively. Data collected from 110 general managers working in the marketing departments of small firms in Jordan. Findings: The study's findings indicated that the young population between the ages of 2-35 years has acknowledged and they usually embrace the use of digital marketing as a cheaper and efficient way of buying not only goods but also services. The aged are reluctant to adopt because they are not well conversant with online marketing whereas others do not trust online purchases. The research results have grave effects on not only the marketing strategies but also the development in the implementation of online marketing in small Jordanian businesses. In this modern era, the use of traditional marketing strategies is fading away with the penetration of online marketing in the social media platforms, emails, blogs, and general troubleshooting engines. Originality: There exist a gap in research in the Jordanian market where most researchers have explored less into the relationship of e-market to the market structure and the small market enterprises and the effects associated with the arising trends in the e-market. The research will also look into the correlation of these parameters to government support and policies. Thus, this research will prove to be instrumental in filling this gap as well as opening the stage for more research to been done on the same line. © 2019 Allied Business Academies.",E-marketing strategic; E-promotion; Jordan; Marketing effectiveness; small business enterprises,,,,Allied Business Academies,15441458,,,,English,Acad.

However, in the developing and to be precise the African context, such studies are somewhat scant. To address this yearlong theoretical and practical gap, this study takes inspirations from the theoretical underpinnings of both micro-institutional view of the firm as well as resource strategic action. Henceforth, this study supplements the existing internet orientation literature and adds to the on-going debate why internet channel orientation stands as the focal point and engine of survival in small and midsized enterprises. In light of this, this study proposes that entrepreneurial capability of the firm and industry competition predict Internet-based channel orientation (IORIENT) of the firm. Furthermore, the study tests the assumption that the utilisation IORIENT not only potentially contributes to greater market-sensing capability but that it can also indirectly lead to firm competitiveness. Survey data from 198 firms offer initial support for the research propositions. Overall, the research study encourages firms not to only invest in Internet marketing tools but also to effectively use these tools as this is critical to their long-term competitiveness. © 2019, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",Consequences; Domesticated service firms; Drivers; Firm’s competitiveness; Internet orientation,Marketing; Truck drivers; Channel orientations; Consequences; Industry competitions; Internet channels; Internet marketing; Research propositions; Service firms; Small and mid-sized enterprise; Competition,"Kwarteng, M.A.; Faculty of Management and Economics, Tomas Bata University in Zlin, Mostni 5139, Czech Republic; email: kwarteng@utb.cz",Dwivedi Y.Ayaburi E.Boateng R.Effah J.,Springer New York LLC,18684238,9.78303E+12,,,English,IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068477763,1

To attract customers to buy a product, the marketing of a product is usually influenced by various factors, such as price, product quality, and brand. In this study, the researchers analyzed the impact of price, product quality, and product brand on customer’s buying interest. This research is a case study conducted in Fahmi Mandiri SMEs aiming to increase the income. The method used is multiple regression analysis and the data is collected through questionnaires distributed to the customers. The results show that the biggest partial correlation influencing customer buying interest are price of a product and product brand. The quality of a product does not affect customers' buying interest significantly, because consumers will trust the quality of a product when the product brand is known and has the right price. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.

Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are continually encouraged to adopt digital commerce and place themselves in line with competing big enterprises. In the South African SMEs retail industry, digital commerce has not been fully utilized to its full potential. Specifically, SMEs in this industry have not fully adopted social media as a digital marketing platform. The objective of the study was to investigate factors influencing the adoption of social media as a digital marketing platform by SMEs in the retail sector. The study adopted a qualitative systematic literature review approach to understand factors affecting adoption of social media for digital marketing by SMEs. The study used TOE framework as a lens to understand the factors affecting adoption of digital marketing by SMEs. The study results showed that the adoption of social media was influenced by technological factors, organizational factors, and environmental factors. The study revealed that although efforts have been made to study social media adoption within retail SMEs; there are still areas that can be further investigated. The study contributed to our knowledge on the factors influencing the adoption of social media platforms for digital marketing by retail SMEs.

A detailed literature review revealed that the HMR market in Korea is close to saturation. Notably, the technologically advanced products produced using sous-vide seem to display significant potential to overcome market saturation. The sous-vide method differs from conventional cooking techniques and is characterized by maintenance of food texture along with flavor enhancement. However, due to the unfamiliarity of the manufacturers with this method and the unclear food safety regulations, mass food manufacturing companies do not agree on using this method; hence, sous-vide production is usually undertaken by small/medium sized companies catering primarily through online marketing portals. This study highlights the various restrictions to the implementation of sous-vide production, and discusses several practical implications of sous-vide production that would help users of this technique enter the HMR market. © 2019 Korean Society of Food Science and Technology.

To achieve this, an integrated framework for managing the continuous enhancement of their brand equity level by adopting digital marketing tools and techniques (DMTTs), has increasingly become a necessity for most of the modern SMEs. However, even if such an approach provides plenty of benefits, such as better audience targeting and reduction of traditional marketing expenses, implementing these complex processes in their business models poses a series of challenges like choosing the best selection of DMTTs. For this reason, a conceptual model is proposed in the first part of the paper, with the aim to highlight a framework that will help underline the links between DMTTs and other key elements that can provide an increase in brand equity of SMEs, thus contributing to growth and enhancing the sustainability level. Following the proposed model, research aimed at two main directions has been conducted in the second part. The first direction was to analyze the degree in which modern SMEs from the European Union located in Romania dedicate themselves toward embracing sustainability goals and principles. The second one represents an analysis using also the SPSS software solution on the most used selections of DMTTs mentioned in the presented conceptual model. The results obtained provide a starting point for those modern SMEs that choose to follow the path of sustainability by creating and enhancing their brand equity through DMTTs. © 2018 by the authors.",Brand equity; Digital marketing tools and techniques; DMTTs; Modern SMEs; Sustainability; Sustainable growth,conceptual framework; equity; European Union; numerical model; small and medium-sized enterprise; software; sustainability; Romania,"Dumitriu, D.; Faculty of Entrepreneurship, Business Engineering and Management, University Politehnica of BucharestRomania; email: dan.dumitriu@upb.ro",,MDPI AG,20711050,,,,English,Sustainability,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85069779466,3

Despite the impact of social media on businesses' activities has been largely acknowledged, research on their adoption and use by SME is still limited. Therefore, the scope of this study is twofold: bridging a theoretical gap and answering a business problem. In particular, the study aims to analyse social media adoption, level of usage, strategies and barriers in the context of SMEs. Empirical data were collected in two phases: a cross-sectional survey (122 completed questionnaires) followed by a multiple case study analysis of seven SMEs. The findings show that, despite a high adoption rate of social media, its actual usage often seems to be improvised and lacking a clear strategy. SMEs seem to be deficient of an adequate organisational structure, skilled human resources and financial resources. A positive relationship between the presence of a marketing function and social media use also emerged.

These organizations work under different conditions, possess different capabilities, and therefore have a different approach to certain company functions (e.g., marketing). SMEs define their marketing activity within a scope that differs from their large counterparts. Our aim is to provide a better understanding of certain influencing factors that are the antecedents to the understanding of an SME’s marketing activities. Design/Methodology/Approach – Since relatively little has been written on these effects, we decided to use a qualitative approach because of both the sample (SMEs) and the research problem. The SME marketing activity was analyzed from an exploratory perspective, with the research conducted in the form of in-depth interviews in 15 SMEs. We had the opportunity to analyze our research questions in a Hungarian context. Findings and implications – As a result, some influencing patterns emerged, such as the deciding role of the SME leader, strong customer focus, the ability to adapt to the market, and innovative, entrepreneurial characteristics. The results can help both theoretical researchers of SME marketing and SME marketing practitioners. Limitations – The limitations of this paper lie in the sample size and structure, and in the limitations of qualitative methodology. Originality – Despite limitations, the influencing factors that emerged have not been analyzed in prior empiri cal studies in terms of SMEs’ decision-making factors in the context of online marketing and use of social media tools. By answering our research questions, we can provide a better explanation of how marketing decisions are made by SMEs. © 2019, University of Zagreb, Faculty of Economics and Business Zagreb.

Using the beta value of the standardization factor, the relative effect of the three independent variables on the dependent variables of export performance was shown to be the product (.376), followed by the customer (.294) and logistics (.183). Unlike other studies, logistics competence is of low importance, which is not due to the importance of logistics factors, but rather related to the use of advanced logistics services by the open market. Third, marketing capabilities have been shown to affect the financial and non-financial performance of open market operators. For the open market entry shopping malls in this study, it was found that marketing capabilities were the most influential in terms of non-financial performance among export performance on increased purchases by existing customers. Although generalization of the results of this study is limited, as it only targets analysis of marketing performance factors in open-market shopping malls, it provides a basis for the necessary marketing mix to power sellers and the policy direction for e-commerce development. © 2019 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.",Business-to-consumer (B2C); Customer satisfaction; Korean wave; Marketing factors; Online export; Online marketing; Open market,,"You, Y.-Y.; Dept. of Smart Convergence Consulting, Hansung UniversitySouth Korea; email: orthreey0818@hansung.ac.kr",,Primrose Hall Publishing Group,22011315,,,,English,Int.

It highlights how the hyped services of search engine marketing (SEM) are not as successful as they seem to be and sometimes affect firms negatively. This study uses social media analytics to derive insights from Twitter using descriptive, content and network analytics. Methods like hashtag analysis, polarity and emotion analysis, word analysis, topic modeling and other relevant approaches have been used to mine user generated content. A qualitative case study on an e-market is used for validation of findings. SEM services provided by small organizations and freelancers are not as beneficial as the ones by established players. The services provided by these firms proved detrimental for the customers based on user experiences surrounding these services in the social media and forum specific discussions. This study highlights how SEM often not only fails to provide benefits but also destructs value if not done properly.

The outcome of our case study confirms the earlier findings that a software process is highly dependent on situational factors.

While data mining is sometimes presented as an objective and neutral technique by which to rationally understand and predict phenomena, we observe that there is an important affective dimension in how people understand, engage in and respond to data mining practices. We report the findings of a small exploratory pilot study conducted in 2016 in which we used ethnographic methods to observe the culture of a collaborative project between data scientists and a small digital marketing company. The project aimed to explore potential uses of data mining techniques in the process of telesales lead generation. Thematic analysis of collected data indicates that even in the case of a small scale project, the practice of mining data is deeply influenced by an underlying affective dimension. While these affective dynamics rarely surfaced explicitly in discussions between team members, it is clear from our interview data that feelings and emotions had a significant impact on how participants experienced and engaged with the practice of data mining. Our findings point to the necessity for a much deeper understanding of, and reflexivity in relation to, the affective dimension of data mining practice and how it emerges in the cultures and practices of data science projects. We argue that a deeper awareness of, and openness about, this affective dimension could benefit practitioners’ understanding of their own practice and motivations in decision making, and thus has the potential to improve data science practice. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.",Affect; Data mining; Data practices; Data science; Emotion,Behavioral research; Decision making; Affect; Affective dimensions; Collaborative projects; Data practices; Data science; Emotion; Ethnographic methods; Exploratory studies; Data mining,"Bates, J.; Information School, University of SheffieldUnited Kingdom; email: jo.bates@sheffield.ac.uk",Chowdhury G.McLeod J.Gillet V.Willett P.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

Comparing with, let's say 5 years ago, today is necessary a certain level of knowledge for some online activities like online marketing manager, social media manager, SEO specialist, PPC specialist, digital strategist, copywriter, graphic designer, account manager. In this respect the social media campaigns became more sophisticated and more expensive. On the other hand, for the freelancers and for the SMMs these kinds of activities became less affordable form two points of view - knowledge and budgets. The article proposes an approach to marketing and online sales from the point of view of the freelancers and the SMEs. They can only spend time, people, and money only to a small extent and for very short periods, requiring concrete and quick results. They need an alternative approach for the understanding of the online activities results that show them if they are on the right way, and to go ahead step by step toward the coverage the wishes and the clients' needs.

Design/methodology/approach: Structural equation modeling using SPSS/AMOS was majorly applied to ascertain the relationship and hypotheses testing. First, the correlation of eM toward EBBT is examined using five factors: internet marketing (IM), e-mail marketing (EMa), intranet marketing (IMa), extranet marketing (EM), and mobile marketing (MM). Second, the relationship of each dimension of the eM model is determined autonomously to ensure the importance of such emerging technologies in marketing communications. Third, the effect of gender as a moderator is measured. To this end, primary data were collected through random distribution of the questionnaires among 1,600 consumers particularly students of the universities between February 2016 and August 2016 within North China. Findings: The findings revealed that eM has a significant correlation on consumers’ EBBT. The comprehensive analysis of each factor of eM, i.e., IM, EMa, IMa, EM, and MM is positively correlated to EBBT. The present study revealed that gender did not moderate among the relationships of eM and EBBT. Additionally, study furnishes practical directions on how managers can utilize such emerging and revolutionary technologies in marketing activities to probe, understand, and reinforce consumers’ buying behavior. Research limitations/implications: The research has limitations related to geographical location and sample size which thus limits the widespread generalization. Practical implications: This study affirmed that organizations must engage the consumers using such technologies that are more likely acceptable by consumers in the present customer-oriented and digital era. The marketers must engage consumers the way they wish to be engaged by developing appropriate promotional strategies. The study provides possible implications both theoretical and managerial along with a contribution to the literature of eM and consumers’ buying behavior. Social implications: Understanding the emerging technologies may furnish valuable insights for individuals to work well within Chinese SMEs. Originality/value: The topic of eM has acknowledged as an evolving concept which is gaining an intense concern of both academician and practitioners. Therefore, more research mainly empirical work is still needed to probe the insights of eM across the globe. This study attempts to fulfill such need with empirical evidence together with an in-depth examination of eM determinants, collectively and autonomously. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Consumers’ insights; Electronic marketing (eM); Exploratory buying behavior tendencies (EBBT); Mobile and e-mail marketing; People Republic of China,,"Waheed, A.; University of Science and Technology Beijing, Donlinks School of Economics and ManagementChina; email: abdulwaheed168@yahoo.com",,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,17465265,,,,English,Baltic J.

The extending introduction of DM into the business by big corporates has set examples for the SMEs as well to get the benefit of this innovation. At the same time, escalating customary practice of DM in business, marketing and globalization demands that various aspects of this technology be evaluated and through a systematized study finding shreds of evidence of benefits, disadvantages, elaborations and suggestions to cope with probable deficient areas so that SMEs could gain and harvest the real fruit of DM. This review paper highlights the above-mentioned areas of Digital Media utilization in enhancing and facilitation of business, particularly, Small and Medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The discussion and awareness could intensify performance of SMEs, possibly by boosting business, extending market base, better customer satisfaction and after-sales-service under United Arab Emirates (UAE) scenario. Highly relevant articles have been reviewed and integrated to strengthen the knowledge base and increasing awareness of the practitioners and end users, the SMEs. Published and online material on the subject has been referred to elaborate major aspects of the subject. The study revealed the innovative characteristics of digital media for SMEs, especially in the Middle East and UAE have been described, pointing out a positive link between DM and business performance. It has been identified that the SMEs can reach customers throughout the globe without consideration of time and geographical zones. The digital communication, marketing, live chatting and online payments through digital media are highly easy, convenient, time and cost saving and sustainable. The study has offered SMEs with innovative scenarios, a better perspective of their business and market environments. The study conclusions provide important insights that could guide UAE SMEs in their understanding of Digital innovation and its benefits in emerging markets affecting business performance. The findings also point out a few disadvantages like increased competitions and open options for customers to purchase from any other SMEs based on price and quality comparisons by visiting various websites. To remain in the competition, sometimes prices must be reduced which may affect profit margins consequently. Therefore, SMEs may devise managing strategies to address possible losses. However, the study is limited to SMEs operating in the Middle East and UAE markets. Future research and investigations will be required that could look the subject in other countries, regions and the globe. Individual case and quantitative studies can also be undertaken in which selected SMMEs of different sectors may participate. Coping strategies to manage disadvantages and deficiencies of DM can also be devised through appropriate studies. © 2018 Allied Academies.",Business performance; Digital media; Digitizing of activities and procedures; Marketing; Small and medium-sized enterprises; UAE scenario,,"Nuseir, M.T.; Al Ain University of Science and TechnologyUnited Arab Emirates",,Allied Business Academies,10879595,,,,English,Acad.

We sought to profile the product mix, advertising, marketing, and other business practices of United States landscape firms and compare them by business type (landscape only, landscape/retail, and landscape/retail/grower) as well as by firm size. We sent the 2014 Trade Flows and Marketing survey to a wide selection of green industry businesses across the country and for the first time included landscape businesses. Herbaceous perennials, shade trees, deciduous shrubs, and flowering bedding plants together accounted for half of all landscape sales; 3/4 of all products were sold in containers. However, landscape only firms sold a higher percentage of deciduous shrubs compared with landscape/retail/grower firms. Landscape businesses diversified their sales methods as they diversified their businesses to include production and retail functions. Landscape businesses spent, on average, 5.6% of sales on advertising, yet large landscape companies spent two to three times the percentage of sales on advertising compared with small- and medium-sized firms. Advertising as a percent of sales was three to four times higher for landscape/retail/ grower compared with landscape only or landscape/retail firms; most respondents used Internet advertising as their primary method of advertising. The top three factors influencing price establishment in landscape businesses were plant grade, market demand, and uniqueness of plants, whereas inflation was ranked as the least important of the nine factors provided. A higher percentage of small and mediumsized firms perceived last year’s prices as more important in price establishment compared with large firms. A high percentage of large landscape companies said the ability to hire competent hourly employees was an important factor in business growth and management, but this was true only for about half of the small and medium-sized landscape companies. © 2017, American Society for Horticultural Science.

Study level/applicability: Undergraduate and graduate capstone course in entrepreneurship, strategic management or management information systems courses. Case overview: This case study of a young technology firm, Codezin Technology Solutions, helps to analyze the challenges faced by such firms in emerging markets. Such markets are characterized by rapid turbulence in the market characteristics. The authors seek to analyze the role of disruptive regulatory changes, resulting in the growth of new startups, in affecting the growth and expansion of such young firms. Codezin was established in 2009 as a bootstrap company, to provide low-cost IT services to Indian small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs). Despite some initial success, it began to run into losses due to poor coordination and improper planning. After a period of struggle, the company stabilized its revenue from services business and expanded to mobile solutions, digital marketing, etc. But then the government of India announced the Startup India initiative at the beginning of 2016 to boost new ventures. Codezin did not qualify as per the government rules and thus failed to use the various incentives offered. Hence, it needs to determine a new strategy to compete with the onslaught of freshly funded startups but with a relative lack of market experience. Expected learning outcomes: With the case discussion, the students will gain rich insights on technology businesses aimed at SMEs and the impact of changes in the regulatory regime in emerging markets like India. Further, they get to step into the shoes of the co-founders and choose between diversification vs new market development strategies, spurred by market disturbances and thinning competitive advantage.

Web 2.0 marketing is a marketing medium that allows business to collaborate through sharing activities such as content and multimedia. This study explores the value which Web 2.0 marketing adds to the Nigerian SME’s. The analyzed data showed that SME’s most common marketing tool is Facebook, service-rendering companies also adopt Blogging tool and product-selling businesses prefer the picture platform (Facebook and Instagram). The major Web 2.0 marketing benefits achieved by the Nigerians SME’s are increase in brand awareness and revenue. However, the benefit of getting high search engine optimization (SEO) rank is not leveraged. One major challenge is lack of in house skills is the most common faced in the adoption of Web 2.0 marketing as most of the online marketing is done by unskilled employees in the company; this issue leads to several challenges. It is recommended that the SME’s should hire or outsource certified digital marketers for effective management and achievement of optimum Web 2.0 marketing strategy benefits.

This model of marketing covers activities and transactions with a digital mechanism. This research included the sample of 30 MSME (Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises) businesses of traditional and finished clothes originated in Pontianak City. Stratified sampling technique was applied. In addition, questionnaires with each process divided based upon the levels were in use. These levels were served by using Guttman Scales. The aims of this research were to cognize gap values of maturity levels and propose a recent model of IT governance to reach expected maturity levels. Results show that the lowest values of maturity levels are at PO8 (2.336) and DS5 (2.560). Therefore, redefinition of information architectures, IT resources, quality management, estimation and management of IT risks, system improvement of IT infrastructure management, IT investment strategies, and communication are of great importance.

Study level/applicability: This case can be used for students studying marketing management courses and also for elective courses on consumer behaviour, digital marketing and strategic management in an MBA programme. Case overview: This case is about Anju Pharmaceuticals which dealt in the manufacture and sale of ayurvedic/herbal products such as Panchsudha, Zalim Lotion, Ruz, Vama, Mekado etc. in Madhya Pradesh, India. Started in the year 1983, the company had still not been able to make a mark in the market. For quite some time now Mitesh, the third-generation proprietor of the company, was continuously reading articles which discussed how there has been a positive shift in the consumer preferences for products having herbal ingredients. Indian fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies such as Patanjali, Dabur, Marico were banking on herbal components in their various key products such as toothpaste, shampoo and hair oil to expand their market share and some of these Indian companies seemed to be growing faster than bigger multinationals including Hindustan Unilever and Procter & Gamble. With the changes in consumer perception towards herbal products, Mitesh was hopeful that if he could gear up his distribution it would result in improving the bottom-line of the company. He had also started receiving queries from interested clients for third-party manufacturing and packaging of the ayurvedic products under the desired brand name. Mitesh was very much aware that to improve his bottom-line, just relying on efficient distribution would not suffice and he would need to come up with strategic alliances and newer ways of doing the business rather than just following what had been the norm for the last few years. The idea of becoming a third-party manufacturer somehow did not excite Mitesh because he felt that by going in for third-party manufacturing he would never be able to establish the brand identity of Anju Pharmaceuticals. He wanted his company to ride the FMCG herbal wave but how and at what cost were the big questions facing him. Expected learning outcomes: After the successful completion of this case, the readers would be able to accomplish the following: gain insights into the problems faced by small businesses when they want to scale up their business. Get insights into the challenges/difficulties of adopting e-commerce by a small organization. Be aware of the changing consumer preferences for herbal and ayurvedic products and how companies are gearing up to cash on to the changing market opportunities. Comprehend the problem situation. Suggest ways of taking advantage of the current scenario to expand and grow the business. Supplementary materials: Teaching notes are available for educators only.

However, the efficiency of Internet advertising for microenterprise is not very high, since Wi-Fi advertising—which is limited by a small router coverage area—is mainly used. Moreover, because of the lack of money, microenterprises have been using low-cost methods to promote their products. Thus, enhancing the effectiveness of Wi-Fi advertising, and solving the problem of cost and the range of the views are now an essential investigation in this study. In this paper, we propose a reciprocal model with Wi-Fi union mechanism for Internet advertising based on fog computing architecture to enhance the efficiency of advertisement, reduce the cost, and increase the range of the views for microenterprise by using the Internet. In particular, the system was built in advertisers’, publishers’, and consumers’ sides. In our system, we use contribution point (CP) as an exchange value among the participants. Advertisers and publishers can get CP by helping the others in the system to promote their advertisements, increasing their CP by one unit. Similarly, advertisers and publishers can use their CP to ask for assistance from the others, decreasing their CP by one unit. The result shows that the system in a Wi-Fi union is easy to use, and advertisements can be seen by all customers who are using free Wi-Fi from the stores of the union. This method can solve the problem of cost and fixed consumer groups. © 2017, MDPI AG.

Given the importance of retailers in the green industry and little research exists that documents their advertising practices and impacts, the 2013 Trade Flows and Marketing Practices survey included questions to capture data for retail-only firms. This paper reports on the percentage of sales retailers allocate to promotion and advertising, including a breakdown of media used; point-of-sale (POS) materials and how they are acquired; how green industry retailers are using social media and mobile marketing [in particular, quick response (QR) codes]; the methods retailers use to collect customer demographics; customer loyalty programs (CLP); and how they are managed by retailers and a comparison of retail firms’ advertising practices by size of firm. A combination of mailed and Internet-distributed surveys resulted in a total of 699 useable retail business responses with greater than or equal to $1000 in annual revenue. The median expenditure as a percentage of sales on advertising was 3.6% for all retail firms responding with 33.7% spending no dollars on advertising. In examining the distribution based on media type, the Internet was the most frequently listed by firms (32.3%) with a mean expenditure of 42.5% of total advertising dollars. Social media was listed second most frequently (21.5%) with a mean expenditure of 29.6%. Newspapers were listed as the third most frequently used type of media (18.0%). Social media use is strong and among social media platforms, Facebook (60%) far exceeds any other platform. A third of the respondents (34.2%) reported the use of POS materials. A very small percentage of firms (3.0%) reported using QR codes and 19.4% reported having a CLP. Of those, 45.8% used customer purchase cards, whereas 35.4% used POS software. Nearly 33% of the firms collected demographic information about their customers. Of those, the method with the highest percentage use (multiple responses were permitted) was social media (50.7%) followed by CLP (48.9%), web visits (34.5%), questionnaires (15.7%), social coupons (13.5%), census data (3.9%), and marketing firms (3.1%). There were firm-size differences in seasonal employees and mean sales per employee with large firms having greater numbers than hobby, small- or medium-sized firms. There were no differences in the percentage of advertising media allocations based on firm size, but large firms used web visits, social coupons, and social media more than other types of firms to collect customer demographics. While, green industry retailers are currently using social media for marketing green industry goods, they have much more opportunity to use electronic media for CLPs and to begin using QR codes or other mobile-centric technologies to deliver in-store promotional information to consumers. © 2017, American Society for Horticultural Science.

The purpose of this research was to explore the contribution of social media platforms to improve the marketing operations in small businesses. Thus, this study presents some of the results of a questionnaire-based research conducted in the first part of 2017, aiming to reveal the perspective of managers from small companies on adopting and utilizing e-marketing tools towards small businesses promoting process through sales and advertising activities. From the multitude of social media platforms, few are preferred by the companies to strengthen their online presence. Also, the article describes the latest Facebook features used to promote a product or a service on the market, especially for small companies. These findings aim to constitute as baseline for further investigation through research theories and practices for digital marketing development.

Several fingers point in the direction of the high cost of devices, lack of infrastructure, and poor/intermittent supply from providers and many more as reasons for the low uptake. A major concern that emanates from this state of affairs, especially for small firms that have to embrace technology for its acclaimed virtues, is that they have to find creative ways of reaching out to their customers, expand their customer base and generally improve their businesses. Worryingly, considering the value of small businesses in a developing economy such as South Africa, there should be sustained inquiry into the factors that prevent small businesses from blossoming. This study examines social media adoption challenges of small businesses. The purpose of pursuing a study of this kind was based on, among others what is generally considered as: (1) the necessity of social media in business, and (2) the inevitability of social media. Specifically focusing on restaurants in the Cape metropole, the study applied the quantitative method to obtain data which were analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Perhaps surprising, the results suggest that access to the internet in this digital age is one of the most prominent factors that inhibit the adoption of social media by the restaurants surveyed. Other factors include a limited understanding of the role of social media, the capacity of social media, marketing strategies and lack of interest. While there is the urge to associate non-adoption of information technology to limited education, this was not the case as most of the respondents were moderately educated with specific insights in marketing. With digital technology driving marketing efforts nowadays, clearly businesses that choose to ignore or optimally deploy this new media may suffer or continue to suffer excruciating losses. © 2017 AJHTL.",Marketing strategies; Restaurants; Social media; South Africa,,"Oji, O.N.E.; Faculty of Business and Management Sciences, Cape Peninsula University of TechnologySouth Africa; email: obiorji.orji@gmail.com",,Africa Journals,2223814X,,,,English,Afr.

The aims of the research are twofold: a) to investigate the factors that influence the adoption of internet in MEs in developed countries; b) to characterise the MEs in term of internet usage and tools adopted and benchmark different typologies of them. After a thorough analysis of the literature, a research model is created. It consists of two parts. In the first part, four hypotheses are developed in order to investigate the different factors relevant to internet adoption (company size, geographical location, type of industry, and level of internationalisation). In the second part of the research, through a cluster analysis, we analyse the main differences related to internet usage. The statistical analysis was carried out on a sample of 600 Italian MEs. The research shows that the use of the internet is still not widespread. As shown from the regression analysis, the decision to use this technology is influenced by the size of the company, the sector it operates in, and the level of internationalisation, while location is not a significant factor. Cluster analysis shows three different groups of firms related to internet usage.

However, what remains under-explored in tourism literature is the depth of integration of social media marketing into the competitive strategies of emerging tourism small, micro and medium enterprises (SMMEs). To address this grey area, this study explored the extent to which tourism SMMEs utilize social media technologies (SMTs) to extend their market share and the implications thereof for the competitiveness of their business operations. Drawing on a quantitative approach, a survey was conducted on 234 tourism SMMEs' owner/ managers in the Free State province of South Africa to establish the impact of social media marketing on the competitiveness of their businesses. Evidence suggests that tourism SMMEs employed social media marketing predominantly for online marketing of their products/services, promoting their products/services, attracting existing customers, and sometimes, for integrating it into their marketing strategies. Results of correlation analysis revealed that social media marketing is positively and significantly related to the competitiveness of tourism SMMEs. The recommendations for leveraging the integration of social media marketing into the competitive strategy of the small business are provided. © Patient Rambe, 2017.",Business competitiveness; Social media marketing; Social media technologies,,"Rambe, P.; Department of Business Support Studies, Central University of TechnologySouth Africa",,LLC CPC Business Perspectives,17277051,,,,English,Probl.

But non-indigenous crayfish are available through the pet trade in Ireland, and the release of pet crayfish is a major route for introducing crayfish into natural ecosystems. Monitoring online classified-advertising websites provided evidence for three non-indigenous crayfish species owned and traded in the Republic of Ireland-Procambarus clarkii, Cherax quadricarinatus and Cambarellus patzcuarensis-in addition to Procambarus fallax f. virginalis, previously determined to be available in the pet trade in the Republic of Ireland. The risks associated with introductions of C. quadricarinatus and C. patzcuarensis in Ireland have not yet been assessed. The invasive potential for both may be limited by low cold tolerance, but C. patzcuarensis is a potential vector for crayfish plague, and C. quadricarinatus may outcompete native A. pallipes in aggressive interactions. The number of species available in Ireland is smaller than in most other European countries, but the number of advertisements per capita and species available in the Republic ofIreland was higher than in England, where one species is legal. This suggests legislation may limit initial imports, but individual pet owners or small businesses continue to sell and trade crayfish that have been transported to Ireland. © ROYAL IRISH ACADEMY.",,,"Faulkes, Z.; Department of Biology, University of Texas Rio Grande ValleyUnited States; email: zen.faulkes@utrgv.edu",,Royal Irish Academy,7917945,,BENVE,,English,Biol.

Design/methodology/approach: In order to examine the content and structure of the information found on the website of selected FBs, an ad hoc analysis model was designed and validated with the support of marketing and industry experts through an inspecting focus group (Mich, 2007). Findings: The subsequent observation of the websites of the businesses studied showed that family-run Italian wineries use their websites mainly to present information about the business and as a relational tool through edutainment activities; FBs yet neglect the potential of e-commerce. Research limitations/implications: The study highlights the importance and the attention that FBs, among others, should dedicate to the role of web communications within their communications strategy. Although this path has allowed the traits essential to launch effective online communications for FBs, the small number of businesses surveyed (ten) does not permit a theoretical generalisation of the results.

Digital marketing analysts and data scientists rely on social media analytics tools to deduce customer sentiment from countless opinions and reviews. While numerous attempts have been made to improve their accuracy in the past, yet we know surprisingly little about how accurate their results are. We present an unbiased study of users' tweets and the methods that leverage the available tools & technologies for opinion mining. Our prime focus is on improving the consistency of text classifiers used for linguistic analysis. We also measure the impact of lexical richness in the sample data on the trained algorithm. This paper attempts to improve the reliability of sentiment classification process by the creation of a custom vote classifier using natural language processing techniques and various machine learning algorithms. © 2016 IEEE.",lexical richness; machine learning; natural language processing; opinion mining; sentiment classification; social media,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Commerce; Data mining; Information science; Learning systems; Linguistics; Marketing; Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); lexical richness; NAtural language processing; Opinion mining; Sentiment classification; Social media; Learning algorithms,,Rodrigues J.J.P.C.Siarry P.Perez G.M.Tomar R.Pathan A.-S.K.Mehta S.Thampi S.M.Berretti S.Gorthi R.P.Pathan A.-S.K.Wu J.Li J.Jain V.Rodrigues J.J.P.C.Atiquzzaman M.Rodrigues J.J.P.C.Bedi P.Kammoun M.H.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

As SMEs are generally characterized by shortage of resources, the use of online marketing strategies is apparently difficult. However, the current landscape of competition among SMEs in a global market economy prompts the necessity of adopting online marketing. With these, the decision-making process of SMEs in this area becomes complex and the decisions must integrate complex and interrelating criteria and constructs in order to provide a more holistic solution. Thus, this work adopts a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method particularly the analytic network process (ANP) in order to evaluate the practicability of using online marketing for service SMEs. It becomes highly relevant as it provides significant insights to decision-makers in SMEs regarding the use of online marketing strategy. The contribution of this chapter lies in the application of MCDM in evaluating viability of online marketing in service SMEs. © 2017 by IGI Global.

More specifically, cost behavior, cost estimation, cost prediction, cost-volume-profit (CVP) analysis, contribution income statement and pricing/promotional strategy. Study level/applicability: This case is suitable to be used in advanced undergraduate level. Case overview: This case demonstrates the issues relating to pricing strategy of “Video Internet Marketing Training”. Diyana Tahir and her husband, Abdul Rahim Abdul Shukor, established Aras Design & Multimedia Centre (ADMC) on January 17, 2009. The main office was located at Kuala Lumpur. Diyana was a well-known name in the field of internet video marketing training. In its early years, ADMC’s operation was limited to providing printing and graphic design services and offering printing materials for photocopy. However, with the passage of time, the company began to expand its services and offerings. At the beginning of 2010, ADMC offered editing facilities and services for video and multimedia in addition to its core services. As a unique marketing strategy, Diyana offered RM30 as the basic training fee for each participant, which was equivalent to RM470 value offered. In this way, she attracted customers to take part in further advanced level training that was conducted by ADMC. However, she felt that the number of participant to take advanced training was not satisfactory. She thought that it happened perhaps due to the fact that the participants were not much committed to the course since it was offered at a nominal price. Furthermore, she realized that the cost of providing such training had risen in the past six months. Currently, ADMC suffered losses in three consecutive months, and they really needed enough cash to sustain. As such, Diyana was thinking to reconsider the offered course fees whether to increase it. She was in a rush to make a decision to propose the new course fee in the monthly meeting with management committee at the end of April 2013. Expected learning outcomes: Using this case, students can learn how a small-scale company can strategize its pricing strategy to survive in the highly competitive online market. The objectives of using this case are as follows: to help students in understanding the interrelationships between CVP in organization that can be used for future planning and decision-making; to be able to identify the cost structure of the basic training course (e.g. fixed and variable costs), determine the contribution margin, break-even point and prepare the contribution income statement that highlighting cost behavior; to help students to think critically while setting the price for the offered services; to develop students’ ability in analyzing the existing situation to come up with a viable and effective solution; to assist students in taking the right move in a right time; to broaden students’ views and understanding in considering the monetary aspect along with the human aspect in formulating an effective marketing strategy; to develop students’ understanding of the way to retain and attract customers through innovative pricing strategy; and to make students aware that innovation is the key to business success.

A systematic review of literature has identified three research questions regarding the main relational, marketing and search optimization tools adopted by small and medium enterprises (SMEs). These research questions have been subsequently addressed through a survey that involved 73 handicraft and/or retail SMEs operating in jewelry industry. The survey results point out that in few years the scenario has changed and SMEs are generally inclined to use traditional technologies instead of the updated ones, which are also cheap and easy to use. These results show the problems of SMEs to be reactive to the fast technological changes that are affecting marketing, as well as the low-intense support from ICT vendors in the process of choosing the adequate webbased solutions. The paper also highlights that SMEs typically do not have resources focused on the evolution of the digital market and they are not even able to follow the technologic dynamic environment. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers.

It is important for managers to have the complete and correct opinions and feedback from their clients as soon as possible to make the right decisions. Big companies and even small and medium enterprises have their own information systems, which deliver sales reports, graphics, statistics, and forecasts. Also, they have an Internet portal for e-commerce and for communicating with their customers. But this is not enough. Data must be completed with the information circulating on social media, which could give the management another type of insight and would increase the competitiveness in the target field by improving the creative industry, the involvement of potential customers in style design, and in defining utility, quality, and comfort for new products. This chapter is structured into four sections to achieve our research objectives: first, an overview of the actual stage of Romanian clothing and fashion industry, and second, a study of competitiveness improvement in Romanian apparel using new information technology and communication technologies and a theoretical solution to explore social media information, considered as a significant factor in decision-making. In the third section is presented the Romanian clothing industry face-to-face with the economic crisis, as well as its slow but steady recovery since 2013. Also, this part is intended to provide several ways to increase the competitiveness in Romanian apparel and fashion on the international market, focusing on originality, quality, online commerce, and marketing. The fourth part includes the methodology and presents two evolving technologies, strongly connected, namely cloud computing and big data, and two important applications for social network analysis: Gephi and NodeXL. Also, in this section, we propose a model for integrating big data with an existing enterprise resource planning system, thus leading to a four-layer architecture based on a cloud-based Hadoop implementation. Finally, the chapter highlights the influence of big data on decision-making throughout the fashion supply chain and the points of view of all the actors involved. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.",Analysis software; Big data; Business environment; Clothing industry; Cloud computing,Cloud computing; Commerce; Competition; Decision making; Distributed computer systems; Electronic commerce; Enterprise resource planning; International trade; Product design; Sales; Social networking (online); Social sciences computing; Supply chains; Analysis softwares; Business environments; Clothing industry; Competitiveness improvement; Enterprise resource planning systems; Information technology and communications; Small and medium enterprise; Social media informations; Big data,"Banica, L.; University of PitestiRomania",,Elsevier Inc.,,9780081005804; 9780081005712,,,English,Inf.

Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 women SBOs who were recruited through purposeful sampling methods. Interview data on communication technologies participants used were broken down into six main categories: internet search, internet advertising, online transactions, telephone, email and fax. Participants were also asked questions regarding proximity between them and different business contacts, and whether technology influenced how they communicated with these individuals. Findings: All participants had moved up from having a basic website to transacting goods and services online. ICTs were used to acquire tangible and intangible resources as well as for informal learning. Geographical distance between SBOs and individuals within their business and convenience of ICT failed to affect participants’ preference for face-to-face communication with key business contacts. Research limitations/implications: This study has limitations that tend to be commonly found in exploratory studies, such as a small sample size. However, the findings lay the groundwork for future quantitative studies that examine the potential influence of other factors, such as gender and culture, on adoption of ICT by SBOs. Originality/value: This study responds to a call for research that develops a more nuanced understanding of how women SBOs use ICTs in their business. The findings can be used by policymakers and development agencies in their teaching and training interventions. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Information and communication technology; Small business; Women small business owners,,"Sharafizad, J.; School of Business and Law, Edith Cowan UniversityAustralia; email: j.sharafizad@ecu.edu.au",,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,13287265,,,,English,J.

On the basis of technology acceptance theories at the individual level as well as qualitative research this study develops theory, hypotheses, and a measurement instrument on factors and mechanisms influencing the strategic application of social media in SMEs. In line with technology acceptance theories, the results show that SME executives are mainly influenced by the expectancy of low returns as well as high perceived risks to not adopt social media applications in their companies. In contrast, aspects of perceived ease of use of social media have no effect on their social media adoption. However, aspects of perceived ease of use require a closer analysis on more complex patterns in the context of social media adoption in SMEs.

Automated website evaluation is explored as a complementary tool in the evaluation of small and medium enterprise (SME) winery websites. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopted a mixed-method investigation including a critical review of winery website evaluation literature and analysis of winery website scores generated through a free service of a commercial automated evaluation scoring system. Findings: No standards currently exist for winery website evaluation metrics and current evaluation processes suffer from human rater bias. An automated evaluation scoring system used in the study was able to discriminate between a sample of known best practice websites and other independently formed samples representing average wineries in the USA and in North Carolina. Research limitations/implications: Wineries and other small business tourism firms can benefit by incorporating automated website evaluation and benchmarking into their internet strategies.

Even small business organizations are taking attempts to expand their business by reaching larger customer base. Today social media is vastly used by many businesses to promote their websites, products or services through online process. Social media marketing has changed the traditional form of marketing from one-to-one marketing to one-to-many marketing and many-to-many marketing. This interactive way of marketing has attracted the interests of large communities online. It connects service providers, companies and organizations with a broad audience of influencers and consumers. That is why for the success of a business, the social media presence on the web is very much essential for reaching out to consumers and establishing brand.

However, for it to sustain this growth, media providers must supply a comparable means of tracking an advertisement's effectiveness to online advertising. The problem is a continual and emerging area of research for large outdoor advertising corporations, and as a result of this, smaller companies looking to join the market miss out on providing clients with valuable metrics due to a lack of resources. In this paper, we discuss the processes undertaken to develop software to be used as a means of better understanding the potential effectiveness of a fleet of private car, taxi or bus advertisements. Each of the steps present unique challenges including big data visualisation, performance data aggregation and the inherent inconsistencies and unreliabilities produced by tracking fleets using GPS. We cover how we increased the metric aggregation algorithm performance by roughly 20x, built an algorithm and process to render data heat maps on the server side and how we built an algorithm to clean unwanted GPS 'jitter'.

Moreover, it strives to investigate empirically the effects of various online advertisement contexts on consumer emotion, attitude, and behavioral intention. We used event-related potentials (ERPs) in a scenario-based laboratory experiments. Data collected from 166 customers provide strong support for the research model. Through EEG and SEM analyses, in rational advertisings, consumers' olfactory was triggered and both arousal and pleasure of the emotions affected the attitudes; in emotional advertisings, not only olfactory but gustatory were triggered and only pleasure affected the attitudes.

So our e-commerce industry's development prospects will be broader. Under the e-commerce environment, the competition towards online sellers has become more and more diverse and dynamic than the traditional competition game model. The rapid development of e-commerce makes more and more companies begin to get involved in this area, the market competition has become much fiercer. The vast majority of sellers on e-commerce platform can be viewed as a small business organization, and those businesses who sell similar products is single point of competition and multi-point competition. The sales strategies and mutual games towards the sellers also become increasingly fierce. At present, the game theory are basically involved in the one-dimensional game, few scholars have presented and applied multidimensional game in products pricing strategy; and few scholars have studied a little about one-dimensional game under the e-commerce environment, which mainly focused on the supply and demand sides 'complete information game. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce multidimensional game to study the game towards multi-sellers under the e-commerce environment, and find the game mechanism towards online sellers, so as to provide references for the optimization of e-commerce environment. On the basis of the analysis of the e-commerce industry's development environment, we make a summary analysis of the competition and game studies which related to the online sellers. At the same time, we analyze the online sellers' strategy studies of opening online shops and marketing from home and abroad. Faced with the complex and variable market's demands, the games towards online sellers have become more flexible. From the multidimensional game theory, we set the game strategic conditions of online sellers who sell homogeneous products. In view of the e-commerce environment, how do those online sellers choose the advertising inputs, related transaction service inputs and commodities pricing strategies in order to maximize their profits, we establish a multi-seller's multidimensional game model under the e-commerce environment and solve the equilibrium condition. Then we make a primary analysis of the equilibrium results and find the existence of online sellers' optimal game strategy equilibrium under the e-commerce environment. This research has certain guidance significance for the optimization of the sellers' game and their competition behaviors under the e-commerce environment. © 2015 IEEE.",e-commerce; multidimensional game; online sellers,Commerce; Competition; Economics; Electronic commerce; Information science; Marketing; Sales; Competition behavior; Complete information; Development environment; Development prospects; Equilibrium conditions; Multidimensional game; Online sellers; Optimal game strategies; Game theory,"Li, H.; School of Management, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Electronic Commerce and Supply Chain System, Chongqing Technology and Business UniversityChina; email: lihongxia@ctbu.edu.cn",Zhang R.Fernandez V.Zhang Z.Liu S.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78148E+12,,,English,"Int.

Consumers experience products and services via their senses (i.e. sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch). The specific multisensory content of those products and services can influence people's respective attitudes, purchase intentions, and consumption. Today, consumers experiment the world through new technologies, for example, by sharing their feelings via social media, or by creating avatar in a virtual world. The challenge for marketing consists of monitoring new technologies to better understand consumer sensory experiences and to develop innovative actions that will help to improve these experiences. We will begin with the definition of sensory marketing and the role of multisensory processes in consumer experience. Second, we will address the possibility of better understanding the consumer through social media and neuroimaging technologies.

The purpose of this paper is to explain why SMEs use the internet in business processes and to explore the relationship between market orientation and internet usage. Design/methodology/approach – The study amalgamates the technology acceptance model, the motivation model and the integrated model of technology acceptance into one model. Hypotheses are tested with survey data from Belgian SMEs using partial least squares. Findings – One of the findings is that intrinsic and extrinsic motivation are positively significantly related to internet usage intention. No significant relationships were found between behavioural norms and perceived ease of use and between perceived ease of use and the intention to use the internet. Practical implications – Managerial implications include that SME-internet training providers should focus on methods to increase the user’s perceived enjoyment (intrinsic motivation) instead of emphasizing the perceived ease of use of the internet. Originality/value – Researchers as well as practitioners have stressed the gains from implementing market-orientated strategies in firms. Together with the prominence of studies about patterns and characteristics of internet usage, this calls for studies that integrate these two streams of literature.

There are a large number of guest houses operating in South Africa and the hospitality industry is information intensive. Innovative marketing communication becomes a necessity to survive and grow in an uncertain business climate. A quantitative research method was followed. Primary data were collected by means of a survey approach during personal interviews with the guest house owners/managers. Specific corpographic details of guest houses and the most frequently used online marketing communication tools were canvassed. The four most frequently used online marketing communication tools are guest house websites, branded e-mail, search engine optimisation and social networking. The findings suggest that guest houses have to invest more time and money in implementing specific online marketing communication tools, such as social networking and the use of search engine optimisation. The results confirmed the importance of electronic tools in an organisation’s marketing strategy, specifically for small businesses such as guest houses.

In fact, the advent of online and mobile technology has levelled the playing field for the smaller businesses, enabling them to leap the traditional barriers to achieve the economies-of-scale usually the sole domain of larger companies. Further, the pervasiveness of ICT has not just changed communication and purchasing processes, but also has led many businesses, particularly the retailers, to redesign their competitive strategies. One such player is Yoox, an e-commerce intermediary that serves the designer fashion market in 100 countries from a position of leadership. This chapter retraces the historical journey of Yoox Group and conducts an in-depth analysis of its business model. The discussion shows that Yoox Group can be defined as an “e-commerce intermediary” from the organizational perspective and that “e-intermediation” can be a form of extra and inter-organizational support for e-commerce processes. E-commerce processes are highly complex because they imply the fashion producers’ externalization of the entire internet marketing and sales process, from the outsourcing of Web marketing activities and price-setting to billing and logistics. Hence, we will investigate Yoox’s role as its own network’s market maker and mediator and its business network governance mechanisms. The chapter concludes by demonstrating that not one of the theories on inter-organizational relations outlined in Chaps. 2, 3 and 4 can, in isolation, frame the success achieved by Yoox. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",Chief executive officer; Electronic market; Electronic mediator; Market maker; Online store,,"Rossignoli, C.; Department of Business Administration, University of VeronaItaly",,Springer,14311941,,,,English,Contrib.

Design/methodology/approach – The data comprises semi-structured theme interviews in SMEs among 16 managers and 421 survey respondents in Central Finland. Findings – The results of this study reveal that SMEs seem not use the full potential of the new digital tools, and so are not deriving benefit from the opportunities they provide. Furthermore, the results also raise the question of whether SMEs have understood the fundamental change in the nature of communication brought about by digitization. Research limitations/implications – The data comes from one region and thus the research context limits the generalizability of the results. Practical implications – SMEs seem not to be keeping pace with digital developments, mostly due to the lack of knowledge of digital marketing. Most of the studied SMEs do not apply the full potential of the new digital tools and hence are not benefitting fully from them. Social implications – Discussions on the future regional development of SMEs have called for training programmes to help SMEs exploit digitization. This is something that the government should take note of. Originality/value – Whereas the adoption process of new technologies such as IT in general and the internet in particular have been examined in the SME literature, this is among the first studies examining adoption and usage of digital tools from the marketing perspective. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Channels; Digital marketing; Marketing communications; Resources; Small- and medium-sized organizations; Social media; Technology adoption; Tools,,"Taiminen, H.M.; School of Business and Economics, University of JyväskyläFinland",,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,14626004,,,,English,J.

This paper attempted to investigate the influence of marketing strategies in determining the success of an enterprise while exploring market avenues for a small scale firm. The study is based on primary data collected by using a structured questionnaire. Various statistical tools like mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, chi-square, correlation, and factor analysis had been used for data analysis. Analysis of various factors influencing the internal and external business environment suggest that market aesthetics and its market demand were the most decisive factors which influenced the decision of entrepreneurs. Henceforth, it could be summated that while designing the marketing strategies for a firm, the MSMEs made an assessment of various market factors. However, the industry requires constant upgradation of information regarding the use of newer production technology and market requirements for survival in the market and for facing the global pressures.

The sample size in this research is 154 respondents in Malaysia who purchased apparel online and provided their satisfaction level at point-of-purchase and post-purchase stages. Seven-point Likert scale was used to measure the attitude of these respondents in regard to their customer satisfaction. Of the 154 respondents, 64 answered the surveys in Bahasa Melayu (the national language in Malaysia) while the remaining 90 answered in the English language. The case study shows that there are significant differences in all customer satisfaction items between point-of-purchase and post-purchase stages. The results are also different in these items when respondents were differentiated based on the language they used in answering the surveys. Hence, it is important to show students the need to take account of online post-purchase satisfaction as part of the cumulative experience of the online purchaser. Focusing primarily on point-of-purchase satisfaction could mislead an online retailer particularly if dissatisfaction arose in the aftermath of the purchase experience. In addition, examining customer satisfaction in terms of groups (such as language in this case study) could provide further insight into the significant dif-ferences between point-of-purchase and post-purchase in online purchase.",Case study; Conline purchase; Customer satisfaction; Point-of-purchase; Post-purchase,Customer satisfaction; Electronic commerce; Research; Surveys; Business course; English languages; Likert scale; National language; Point-of-purchase; Post-purchase; Sample sizes; Small business; Sales,,,Informing Science Institute,15479714,,,,English,J.

Thus, a new marketing strategy called viral marketing has emerged and it exploits existing social networks to produce exponential increases in brand awareness. The effect of ""online word of mouth""] is a powerful tool for businesses, but its true potential is yet to be discovered. The objective of this research is to analyze this phenomenon through an extensive literature review of the term, as well as an empirical study consisting of indepth interviews conducted with a sample of large Spanish companies. The results indicate that viral marketing can be used for the benefit of both large companies with big budgets and small businesses. Successful experiences of this strategy show that, when integrated with the rest of the company's business strategies, it can improve the recommendation of the brand and increase its visibility in the market.

Increased consumer targetability in sponsored search advertising induces a firm to ""poach"" a competing firm's consumers by directly advertising on the competing firm's keywords; in other words, the poaching firm tries to obtain more than its ""fair share"" of sales through sponsored search advertising by free riding on the market created by the firm being poached. Using a game theory model with firms of different advertising budgets, we study the phenomenon of poaching, its impact on how firms allocate their advertising budgets to traditional and sponsored search advertising, and the search engine's policy on poaching. We find that, as budget asymmetry increases, the smaller-budget firm poaches more on the keywords of the larger-budget firm. This may induce the largerbudget firm to allocate more of its budget to traditional advertising, which, in turn, hurts the search engine's advertising revenues. Therefore, paradoxically, even though poaching increases competition in sponsored search advertising, the search engine can benefit from limiting the extent of poaching. This explains why major search engines use ""ad relevance"" measures to handicap poaching on trademarked keywords. © 2014 INFORMS.",Competitive strategy; Game theory; Keyword relevance score; Online advertising; Paid search; Poaching,,,,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,7322399,,,,English,Mark.

The purpose of this paper is to analyse the visibility and performance of a website and to test the effectiveness of online marketing using the data provided by Google Analytics. Design/methodology/approach - The authors use a class of econometric time series models with unobservable components, Structural Time Series Models (STSM). The authors allow for time-varying trends to take into account the non-stationary behaviour displayed by time series. The authors illustrate the model using daily data from a local tourist website. Three specific questions are addressed: do paid keywords campaigns increase the volume and quality of search traffic? Do paid keywords affect the volume and quality of the unpaid traffic? How do paid and unpaid keywords perform? Findings - The results for the case study show that: first, online campaigns affect traffic volume positively but their effectiveness on traffic quality is uncertain; second, paid keywords do not affect the volume and quality of unpaid traffic; third, the increase in traffic volume is not always due to the paid keywords and the lowest quality visits come from paid traffic. Practical implications - This analysis may help webmasters to design successful online advertising strategies. Originality/value - This study contributes to the development of user-friendly methodologies to monitor website performance.

The use of 2.0 technologies has also been analyzed based on company size. Methodology - An online survey among 90 Spanish retailers provides a number of interesting insights in the adoption rates, the facilitating and disruptive factors in the adoption process, the types of applications used by retailers, and their experiences from them. Prior to filling in the online questionnaires, the recipients were contacted by phone and were informed about the study. A Chi-square analysis has been carried out to contrast the suggested research questions. Findings - Retailers using Social Media as part of their marketing strategy use most social applications for customer-related purposes and see clear benefits in improving customer relations, market communication, improving their after-sales services, and obtaining customer feedback and customer information. Although many differences do not exist between large, medium, and small companies, it is remarkable that large companies use social web tools as branding and small companies as customer service. Research limitations - The main problem of this study has been the low recruitment of answers by retailers. Practical and social implications - Customers are using such technologies in overwhelming numbers and a substantial part of the customer generated content in Social Media is about brands, businesses, and products. Having a good idea about the customer dialog online can provide businesses with very valuable information and help them understand market trends but also identify potential areas of danger and problems. Originality/value of chapter - The adoption of Social Media tools is a topic much studied from demand perspective. Nevertheless, the application to business and, specifically, retailing sector is less analyzed. With this study we pretend to improve this research line from offer perspective.

Media analysis at the time of Jade Goody's death suggested the NHS did not take sufficient advantage of this opportunity to improve cervical screening rates. Google AdWords has been used to recruit and raise awareness of health but we were not aware of its use to supplement media events. Methods. This was an opportunistic service evaluation to accompany a cervical cancer storyline in Eastenders (a TV 'soap opera'). We ran an AdWords campaign based on keywords such as 'Eastenders', and 'cervical cancer' in a one mile radius in East London, linked to one webpage giving details of 10 practices and other links on cervical cancer. We recorded costs of adverts and setting up the webpage. We used routine statistics from Tower Hamlets, City and Hackney, and Newham Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) of the number of smears, eligible populations, and coverage by practice by month from September 2010 to January 2012 to compare the ten intervention practices with controls. Results: Eight people per day in the target area viewed the project webpage. The cost of setting up the website and running Google AdWords was £1320 or £1.88 per person viewing the webpage. Unlike Jade Goody's death, there was no major impact from the Eastenders' storyline on Google searches for cervical cancer. There was considerable monthly variation in the number of smear tests in the 3 PCTs. The AdWords campaign may have had some effect on smear rates but this showed, at best, a marginal statistical difference. Assuming a 'real' effect, the intervention may have resulted in 110 'extra' women being screened but there was no change in coverage. Conclusions: Although the Eastenders storyline seemed to have no effect on interest in cervical cancer or screening, the AdWords campaign may have had some effect. Given the small scale exploratory nature of the study this was not statistically significant but the relatively modest cost of advertising suggests a larger study may be worthwhile.

To this end, a survey was conducted among 388 South African SMMEs using non-probability sampling. The results indicate that hype was created around company websites, businesses advertise online, using online directories, social media and e-mails to promote themselves all to some extent. There was a notable absence of the use of viral campaigns and engagement in online sponsorships.

Specifically, it is unclear how the internet can successfully support export marketing. The purpose of this paper is to examine the drivers and performance outcomes of two patterns of internet use supporting export marketing: the internet as an alternative to a physical presence and the internet as a sales channel. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 115UK-based SMEs involved in ""active online internationalization"". Relationships are examined in a ""soft-modeling"" partial least squares (PLS) analysis. Findings: The findings suggest that online channel support positively enhances export performance for SMEs. Yet, the use of the internet as an alternative to a physical market presence does not lead to higher export performance. Specifically, born-global firms that are relying too much on the internet are prone to fall into the ""virtuality trap"". Entrepreneurial firms that use the internet as a sales channel can improve their overall performance, however. Research limitations/implications: This paper provides some empirical evidence of the existence of the notion of the ""virtuality trap"". The paper also shows that the internet can serve a valuable complementary role. Traditional exporters are likely to use the internet as a complement to, and thus to support, existing physical operations. Practical implications: Managers should focus on relationship building and on-site learning, instead of putting too much emphasis on the internet as a substitute for a physical market presence. Originality/value: The authors develop a framework and explore previously untested relationships that suggest the internet may play a complementary role in firm internationalization. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Born-global; Communication technologies; Exports; Information technology; International marketing; Internationalization; Internet; Performance; Psychic distance; Small to medium-sized enterprises; Virtuality trap,,"Sinkovics, R.

The effective use of data mining approach can offer e-recruitment companies an improved understanding of customers' patterns and greater insights of purchasing trends. However, prior studies on classifier built by data mining approach provided limited insights into the customer targeting problem of job advertising companies. In this paper we develop a single feature evaluator and propose an approach to select a desired feature subset by setting a threshold. The proposed feature evaluator demonstrates its stability and outstanding performance through empirical experiments in which real-world customer data of an e-recruitment firm are used.

However, there is a huge barrier between service-provider-oriented service information publishing and service-customer-oriented service information discovery, which causes that service consumers hardly retrieve the published service advertising information from the Internet. This issue is partly resulted from the ubiquitous, heterogeneous, and ambiguous service advertising information and the open and shoreless Web environment. The existing research, nevertheless, rarely focuses on this research problem. In this paper, we propose an ontology-learning-based focused crawling approach, enabling Web-crawler-based online service advertising information discovery and classification in the Web environment, by taking into account the characteristics of service advertising information.

In general marketing role of Facebook is considered with special attention to the advertising. Advertising on Facebook is briefly introduced with possibilities of advertising targeting and its performance monitoring metrics. The current methods of efficiency measuring of online advertisement from the area of econometric modeling (specifically data envelopment analysis and stochastic frontier analysis) are mentioned and their suitability for use by small and medium enterprises is questioned. The composite efficiency index is proposed to measure online advertising efficiency and to give base for a comparison of online advertising campaigns. It is based on simple measures like clickthrough rate and costs per click, to assure its simple usage and easy result comparison in conditions of small and medium enterprises. Proposed composite efficiency index is tested on sample data from the Slovak Facebook advertising market acquired by our own survey. The efficiency of Facebook advertising campaigns of Slovak companies, which supported our research and provided their data about particular advertising campaign, is measured by composite efficiency index and then compared with estimated data on other online forms of advertising in conditions of Slovak online advertising market. Results show higher Facebook advertising efficiency than efficiency of banner and contextual advertising in Slovakia. Also preferences and expectations about Facebook advertising are investigated by the survey. The highly positive attitude towards advertising on Facebook of Slovak companies was detected. Possible threats to the future of Facebook advertising and Facebook itself are indicated. In discussion are included topics for further research in this area.

Effective strategies to secure sustainability for comfort-zone and growth-oriented enterprises are identified, including the development of online portfolios which acknowledges the presence of habitual entrepreneurship in fashion electronic retailing. This paper represents the first in-depth multiple case study into independent, successful pure-players marketing clothing, footwear and accessories categories online. A qualitative case approach is employed from a social constructionist perspective. Rich data is generated via in-depth interviews with owner-managers. Results are developed through thematic qualitative analysis and theoretical contributions are based on data saturation across cases and fashion categories, thus offering strong horizontal and vertical credibility. Findings stress the role of developing internet-technology competencies, strategic marketing and service capabilities in the quest for successful e-retailing in pure-play enterprises, alongside overseas market development and demonstrate an emphasis on planning for the small firm. The current findings therefore differentiate this group of enterprises from the majority of small firms accused of poor technology utilisation/competency, lack of planning and weak marketing. The paper provides strong understanding of the complexities of organisational development in pure-play retailing. That these firms have navigated the recent recession and that many have survived online for over 10 years emphasises the importance of the strategic directions explained in this paper to the marketing/entrepreneurship interface. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",e-retail; e-SME; Fashion; Organisational development; Pure-play; Retail marketing,,"Ashworth, C.

More theoretical and empirical research is needed to examine how the internet can actually support the marketing needs of individual public houses. Originality/value: The paper provides an examination of the potential of the internet and suggests directions which owners/managers could follow to gain commercial benefit. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Internet; Promotional methods; Pub food; Public houses; Social networking sites,,"Peet, S.; Department of Business and Management Studies, The Manchester Metropolitan University Cheshire, Crewe, United Kingdom; email: S.T.Peet@mmu.ac.uk",,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,17554217,,,,English,Worldwide Hospitality and Tourism Themes,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84898467797,2

How to improve Internet marketing strategy? Which competencies of employees are the most important for the long term company growth? How to educate the employees? How to improve information and communication (ICT) using? The answers to these questions are examined in this article. In the last fifteen years the small and medium-sized companies have been searched by qualitative research. There have been defined seven main competencies which are connected with using ICT. The ICT competencies refer to a firm capacity to deploy their material and intangible resources, usually in combination with skills, to reach desired goals. These competencies have been associated with economic results and also with the companies' web presentation. To solve this task, the authors used various data mining methods and web mining methods. The authors employed decision tree classifiers and association rules as well as class outlier detection methods and hierarchical cluster analysis. The main goal of this contribution is to explore the correspondence between ICT competencies of SME, their web presentation, long term growth and to characterize a successful company. This can help an organization to improve employee's education and to develop all the competencies which are necessary for the successful implementation of ICT. During the long term research the data have been collected within thirty enterprises using multiple interviews. Some companies had developed significantly more ICT competencies than the others and these competencies help them to be more successful and competitive.",Competencies; Data mining; Information and communication strategy; Marketing intelligence; Small and medium-sized companies; Web mining,,"Antlová, K.; Technical University of Liberec, Faculty of Economics, Department of InformaticsCzech Republic; email: klara.antlova@tul.cz",,,12123609,,,,English; Czech,E M Ekon.

The rapid development of the Internet and WWW is having profound impacts on the industry. In fact, according to Tourism Australia, travel and tourism has become the single largest category of products sold over the Internet (Tourism White Paper, Destinations online: approaches for regional tourism organisations, Centre for Regional Tourism Research, Southern Cross University, 2007). With reports of travel purchases being one of the fastest growing segments of the Internet community it is no surprise that the number of tourism operators on the Web has increased considerably over the past few years. This paper presents the results of a longitudinal study that seeks to determine if and to what extent, Regional Tourism Organisations (RTOs) in Australia are leveraging the benefits of Web technology for destination marketing and eCommerce. The study was undertaken over an eight year period from 2000 to 2008, using the Extended Model of Internet Commerce Adoption (eMICA) (Burgess and Cooper, International conference on telecommunications and electronic commerce, Dallas, November, 2000). A significant finding of this study is that despite assertions that the Tourism industry is leading the field in terms of eCommerce adoption (Buhalis and Law, Information and communication technologies in tourism, Ljubljana, Springer, Berlin, 2007), and this may hold true with some providers in the sector (for example, hotels and airlines) it does not appear to be the case with Australian RTOs who have been slow to embrace eCommerce. The results of the study also add support to the premise of eMICA, that is, in developing commercial websites, businesses (particularly, SMEs) in this industry sector typically start simply by establishing a presence on the Web and build on functionality over time, as their experience with and expertise in the use of Internet and Web technologies increases and they become more aware of the benefits the Web has to offer. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Destination marketing; eCommerce; eMICA; Internet; Regional tourism; World Wide Web,,"Burgess, L.; Marketing Research Innovation Centre, Faculty of Commerce, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; email: lburgess@uow.edu.au",,,13895753,,,,English,Electron.

Kirchhoff S.M.,56957982400;,Advertising industry in the digital age,2011,Advertising: Developments and Issues in the Digital Age,,,,1,25,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84946820856&partnerID=40&md5=023fd15832b96c5d5a53d10109a3b500,,"Kirchhoff, S.M.","The advertising industry is a major sector of the U.S. economy, employing hundreds of thousands of workers and accounting for about 2% of the nation's annual output, according to some estimates. Advertising campaigns by large firms and small businesses provide consumers with product information and generate crucial income for newspapers, television and radio stations, magazines, and other ventures. The advertising industry is in the midst of a fundamental restructuring, however. The deep recession has depressed ad spending. At the same time, the industry faces longer-term challenges as consumers migrate from traditional media to digital platforms such as websites, cell phones, mobile e-readers, and gaming networks. The emerging digital market offers great advantages including lower distribution costs, the ability to target ads to individuals rather than broad groups, and more precise tools to measure ad impact. But the rise of cut-rate online advertising has hurt media companies and businesses that depend on ad revenue. The changing structure of the market is also forcing changes in ad presentation and content, with implications for consumer privacy, Internet regulation, and media profitability. U.S. advertising spending declined in 2008. Deeper reductions are forecast for 2009. The sharp drop in ad dollars has prompted advertising agencies and media companies to lay off tens of thousands of workers and curtail production. Though the market is projected to gradually stabilize, some ad-dependent businesses like newspapers and magazines may not see revenues return to pre-recession levels for years, if then. Online advertising has slowed during the recession, though it is expected to claim a growing share of the market over the longer term. Internet advertising has nearly doubled since 2005, to about 12% of the market, and some forecasts call for it to more than double again by 2014. Digital advertisers are experimenting with a variety of approaches to reach consumers, who are not only dispersed among a multitude of Web pages, games, and social networks, but have more power to screen content using pop-up blockers or video recording devices. Firms are using ""behavioral advertising"" (tailoring ads to individuals based on technology that tracks their Web activities) or, increasingly, marketing on their own websites or through bloggers. The most successful approach to date is ""search"" advertising-where companies like Google and Yahoo sell ads as part of consumer-initiated information queries on their browsers. Search advertising, dominated by a few large firms, accounted for nearly half of digital ad revenues in 2008. The online market is generally compressed, with the top 10 digital ad firms garnering 71% of online revenue in the second quarter of 2009. Congress has long regulated advertising to protect consumers and ensure fair competition. Lawmakers are now debating whether, or how, to update advertising laws for the Internet age, without stifling growth or unduly hurting media outlets dependent on advertising revenue. House members are mulling legislation to enhance privacy rights, which could limit the growth of behavioral advertising. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is examining pharmaceutical marketing in social networks and recently set policies for online marketing. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has released guidelines calling on bloggers to disclose paid product reviews. Other potential issues include looking at advertising in online games and online political advertising. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,"Kirchhoff, S.M.",,"Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,9.78162E+12,,,English,Advert.: Dev. and Issues in the Digit.

Meanwhile, sponsored search has become one of the most popular forms of Internet advertising because of its effectiveness and feasibility. As one of the predominant business model for Web search engines, sponsored search plays an important part in search engine studies. Sponsored search is popular among the small scale companies because it lowers risks and broadens market channels for these companies. But there remain many questions to be answered for sponsored search researches: Are sponsored results providing Web users good experience? Are Web search users disturbed by sponsored links on search engine result pages? How does sponsored search result affect the behavior of the search users? It is necessary to look into these questions and give advices to search engines and advertisers to make sponsored search more useful and acceptable. Click-through information is extracted from Web access logs collected by a commercial search engine in China. Based on analysis into this information, click through behavior on sponsored search results and ordinary results are compared. Experimental results show that some hypothesis proposed by previous researches don't accord with practical Web user behavior patterns.

For example, in the domain of online recommender systems, we attempt to recommend information items (e.g., movies, TV, books, news, images, web pages, etc.) that are likely to be of interest to the user. However, the item space is usually very large and the amount of user preference values is small. When the user data are too sparse, it is difficult to obtain a reliable and useful model for recommendation. Whereas large online sites like Amazon and Google can easily access huge volumes of user data, the enormous number of smaller online business sites, which collectively constitute the long tail of the web, are much more likely to have very sparse user data and have difficulty in generating accurate recommendations. One potential solution to the data sparsity problem is to transfer knowledge from other information sources (e.g., Mehta and Hofmann, 2007; Li, Yang, and Xue, 2009). Such techniques for knowledge transfer are called transfer learning (see, e.g., Pan and Yang, 2010). An additional issue is that, in reality, many small websites often attract similar users and/or provide similar items, if not the identical ones, which implies that data about such users/items could potentially be distributed across different systems. For example, Delicious and Digg are both popular online social bookmarking tools. © Cambridge University Press 2012.",,Artificial intelligence; Education; Engineering education; Factorization; Knowledge engineering; Knowledge management; Learning systems; Online systems; Recommender systems; Websites; Computational advertisings; Data mining technology; Data sparsity problems; Information sources; Knowledge transfer; Matrix factorizations; Online recommender systems; Social bookmarking; Search engines,,,Cambridge University Press,,9781139042918; 9780521192248,,,English,Scaling up Machine Learning: Parallel and Distributed Approaches,Book Chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923469647,1

The proposed framework is intended to be used as a guide for B2B firms especially small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) who wish to adopt a proactive approach in the use of information and communication technology for business efficiency and competitive advantage, and those who wish to explore the internet technologies for marketing activities. Design/methodology/approach: Literature from the B2B e-marketplaces and operations of e-marketing fields were analysed, and the findings were synthesised to develop a preliminary conceptual model of e-marketing. The conceptual model was tested empirically through an online survey from various industries in China, Malaysia, and Singapore. Findings: With significant online and offline publications from both academia and industry, there is a growing awareness of the contribution of the e-marketing in the global environment. This new marketing paradigm is reported to reshape the business relationships between both consumer marketers and consumers, improving business processes and enhancing the business exposure in the new markets. Research limitations/implications: The major limitation of this paper is associated with the sample selection. Although the literature findings were international, the empirical study was restricted to China, Malaysia, and Singapore. Therefore, the generalizability of the results may not be applicable for other countries. Furthermore, the majority of the respondents participated were SMEs. Hence, the applicability of findings to large-scale organisations may be limited. Practical implications: The framework allows B2B firms to capitalise and understand the e-marketing opportunities provided by B2B e-marketplace. The framework also offers guidance to marketing managers a most appropriate approach to adopt B2B e-marketplace to perform their e-marketing activities. Originality/value: Based on the need for a framework for e-marketing, this study is significance to: SMEs, marketers, information technology practitioners, and all other stakeholders that adopted the internet and other electronic means for marketing purposes. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Business-to-business marketing; Communication technologies; Competitive advantage; Internet; Marketing; Small to medium-sized enterprises,,"Chong, W.

Web 2.0 creates opportunities and poses challenges for, amongst other things, the management of education and business reputation. This paper aims to look at Web 2.0 and explore the uses to which it might be put in furthering entrepreneurship education in general and education business links in particular. It seeks to describe, explain and analyse the use of Web 2.0 as a marketing communication and educational tool that can add value to existing links between education and business in the UK education system. Design/methodology/approach – Issues around entrepreneurship education and education business links are explored in relation to the social web (Web 2.0) online marketing environment. The paper offers an indication of the uses to which schools, colleges and universities put the social web. It looks at how businesses use Web 2.0 to market and communicate with their education stakeholders about a range of issues. In the social web the rights, duties, obligations, needs and expectations of different stakeholders compete, conflict with and complement one another. Web 2.0 offers scope and space to enhance entrepreneurship education, teaching, learning and assessment. It is a tool that can add value to entrepreneurship education provision and delivery. Findings – The paper explores how businesses and education providers (schools, colleges and universities) position themselves to build effective, efficient and productive relationships in the era of Web 2.0. It looks at how businesses, especially small businesses, might communicate and position their offering through this medium with schools, colleges and universities as well as with their own customers, consumers and other stakeholders to add value, build brand and enhance reputation. Information and misinformation in the Web 2.0 environment are an issue that needs to be addressed in order to engage with and limit potential reputational damage. Used appropriately, Web 2.0 provides opportunities for new forms of stakeholder engagement and can be an efficient and effective tool for communication in as well as across the business and education sectors. In helping develop education business links Web 2.0 is a tool that can further entrepreneurship education through use in action learning environments. It serves as a distribution vehicle for sourcing and accessing information. Originality/value – The paper develops knowledge, grows understanding and offers new insights into online education business communication practices and web brand management. It adds to and brings together academic debates in the areas of entrepreneurship education and social media. Online communities of interest use Web 2.0 to discuss, debate, network, and influence. They seek to lobby as well as shape and form opinion across the political and business spectrum. A model is developed to explain and account for the growth of knowledge through education and business in the Web 2.0 arena. As a communication platform Web 2.0 services the free flow, exchange and distribution of information. It can help build brand value and is an important innovative marketing tool for both education and business. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Education; Entrepreneurialism; Marketing communications; Worldwide web,,"Jones, B.; Leeds Business School, Leeds Metropolitan University, Leeds, United Kingdom",,,14715201,,,,English,J.

They are ""punching above their weight"" in their dealings with larger competitors who are less exposed to these new skills and more restricted in their structures. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 378 small businesses in the South East of England are surveyed and 30 detailed empirical case studies charting the activities of these ""early adopters"" of Web 2.0 tools are developed. Findings: Proactive ""gifted amateurs"" can systematically raise their profile through blogging, networking and judicious use of search engine optimisation techniques. They are competing effectively against larger organisations by applying network effects to their marketing activities, often circumventing the need for increasingly complex IT systems by continuing to rely upon cost-effective Web 2.0 tools and their own networking skills as the business grows. Practical implications - Technology has now developed to the point where the entry costs and barriers to remote and collaborative working have disappeared. ""Gifted amateurs"" can acquire new online marketing skills and secure IT systems, plus the ability to network and collaborate globally if necessary on knowledge projects, by creating virtual (and even disposable) organisations without having to commit themselves to a traditional IT infrastructure. Therefore they can avoid reliance on IT suppliers and grow their businesses in more flexible ways.

A range of examples from our 30 case study businesses are drawn upon to illustrate some of the opportunities and threats associated with these new marketing priorities.

Research limitations/implications: Further research should aim to track this activity as it integrates with more mainstream marketing over time. Practical implications: Developments in the technologies themselves, as well as a reduction in costs, will mean that more and more information will be available to consumers.

The results, based on a cross-industry sample of 603 SMEs, show that whilst some capabilities positively affect the performance of online export activities, others have a detrimental effect.

In this chapter we will present and support the hypothesis that SMEs should stop investing in their web site's design and functionality and start investing in efforts to market their web sites online, no matter how lousy their web site may be in comparison to today's standards. With the support of two case studies, illustrating the successful utilization of internet marketing by two very different SMEs, we will relate how a SME can effectively market their web site online. We will also discuss the tools and techniques available to help an SME successfully begin a journey of internet marketing. © 2009, IGI Global.

Hypotheses are developed and then tested by making use of a large-scale empirical study. The results indicate that a network of effective alliances, the existence of a product champion in the business, and appreciation by the ownermanager of the broader business implications surrounding the implementation of the Internet for marketing, are important to the successful use of the Internet for the marketing of tourism services.

As a result of these processes previous concepts of and methods for company management become insufficient. To gain competitive advantage in the market it is necessary to take more into consideration of such aspects as human resources development, knowledge transfer, and enhancement of customer loyalty. The aim of this article is to present results of research on the changes in the Polish sawmilling industry in the field of management, organisation, and marketing. Surveys and interviews with experts carried out in 2006 and 2008 were main research methods. Modern management systems and organisational structures encountered in Polish sawmilling companies stem to a great extent from specific features of this industry which encompass great dispersion of and dominance of microenterprises (around 9 thousand business entities, including over 90% with employment of up to 9 people). At the same time this industry is of great economic importance – it produces 9.7% of sold production of traditionally defined wood industry (including furniture) and employs 34 thousand people. After a deep crisis at the end of 1990s the economic situation of the industry improved in the period 2006–2008 – in 2007 the industry was characterised by one of the highest growth dynamics amongst the industries of the wood sector. From conducted research it follows that in the Polish sawmilling industry bigger companies, most often having a considerable share of foreign capital, are generally more open to innovative management concepts and techniques. In such companies management is made up of specialist in the field of economics and management more often than in small companies, whereas in smaller firms traditional techniques of company management are used the oftenest, whilst not in all cases this is so because of deliberate action of the management. Moreover, generally in microenterprises the owner himself manages the resources of the organisation, decides the goals of the enterprise and methods for their attainment. On the basis of research it may be stated that part of sawmilling companies regularly streamline their organisational structures (of over 100 surveyed sawmilling firms every third company streamlined its organisational structure in last 5 years), although this is not a common phenomenon. However in the surveyed companies a centralised decision-making structure is dominant which means that there is lack of characteristic of modern organisation “democratisation” of management and “flattening” of organisational structures. Until now full implementation of such modern concepts as: knowledge management, comprehensive quality management, innovation management, lean management, reengineering, benchmarking, time-based management, or coopetition, was not observed in the Polish sawmilling industry. However application of some actions specific to these ideas might be observed. In the context of knowledge management the research showed that not many sawmilling companies have continuous programmes of employee training which significantly limits development of these organisations. In the sphere of quality management every third sawmilling company has an organisational unit responsible for quality, which is a positive phenomenon. However still not all the producers see the necessity of having ISO certificates. With reference to changes in the innovation sphere it was observed that hardly ever sawmilling companies have in their organisation structure units responsible for innovations, R&D, and implementation of new technologies. In recent years new investment have been most often connected with machinery, whereas outlay on purchase of licences, patents or new technologies has been small. Moreover, the research shows that Polish sawmills more and more often change their production profile to further processed products of higher added value. Post-sale service has also been increasing or its scope has been broadened, which evidences modern approach to management in which the client and his loyalty is the most important. The stronger consumer orientation is reflected mainly by the fact that most sawmilling companies create and maintain a permanent network of consumers and have system of preferences for their regular customers. At the same time product promotion, most often over the Internet, is a key marketing technique. This way of communication is most advantageous to big sawmills or sawmills specialising in the production of unique goods. The following factors can be found amongst other factors which have a bearing on winning and keeping the clients: offer of high quality products, low price, unique design, supply on time, and possibility of complaint. However it is a disadvantage that regular marketing research is relatively seldom conducted in sawmilling companies. Some other forms of activity characteristic of modern management trends were observed in the sawmilling industry as well. The examples of such activities include: reduction of poduction area and standardisation (features of lean management), setting company’s priorities and strategy by comparison with the best companies and adaptation of the model practice (benchmarking), commissioning or subcontracting of selected work packages within the framework of continuous cooperation (outsourcing). On the basis of research and declared intentions of management it may be assumed that in the future the variety and scale of modern management practices application in sawmilling companies will grow. © 2009, Instytut Technologii Drewna.

Following the short evolution of search engines from small companies to global media corporations that commodify online information and control advertising spaces, this study brings attention to some of their important political, social, cultural and economic implications. This is indicated through their expanding operation and control over private and public informational spaces as well as through the structural bias of the information they attempt to organize. In particular, it is indicated that search engines are highly biased toward commercial and popular US-based content, supporting US-centric priorities and agendas. Consequently, it is suggested that together with their important role in ""organizing the world's information"" search engines reinforce certain inequalities and understandings of the world. © 2008, Elad Segev.",Google Earth; Information inequalities; Misinformation; Politics of online information; Search engines; Structural biases,,"Segev, E.; Research Institute for Law, Politics and Justice, Keele University, Keele, United Kingdom; email: e.segev@keele.ac.uk",,,1735188X,,,,English,Webology,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-59349102528,2

Although ICT is often presented as a means of reducing the impact of being rural, little is known about the extent or level of use of ICT. This paper addresses these issues. Design/methodology/approach – The paper employs both quantitative and qualitative methods to gather and analyse data. The study had two stages: an initial survey to determine the extent and pervasion of ICT; and a second interview stage to explore the role and applications of ICT. Findings – The authors find that 84 per cent of the businesses use ICT effectively, mainly to provide information and improve service quality. In addition, some firms had adopted very successful methods of using the internet for sales and marketing but ignored supply functions. The authors were surprised to find that ICT was seen as a way of enhancing personal service and that rather than a barrier, it was seen to promote quality of service. Moreover the respondents did seem to have used ICT effectively to overcome the disadvantages of location and rurality. Research limitations/implications – The survey was carried out in a single rural environment and this limits its generalisability. Nonetheless, the study develops some interesting issues about the application of ICT in the rural context. Practical implications – The paper identifies the benefits derived from the enthusiasm of some rural business owners. They had recognised the efficacy of computing and can provide lessons in how to apply ICT to overcome distance. Originality/value – The paper addresses a gap in research and offers some insights into the application of ICT in rural areas. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Hospitality services; Rural economies; Scotland; Small enterprises,,,,,13552554,,,,English,Int.

The exploratory analysis is based on primary data collected from 141 Austrian software firms. For SMEs, the variability in e-marketing usage is very low; a majority utilises e-marketing. For MEs, the distribution is very symmetric, showing a large proportion operating with traditional marketing instruments only. The study reveals that firms that perceive their relative strengths on branding, pricing, product diversity, internationalisation and access to new technologies have adopted more advanced e-marketing support. The results reveal evidence supporting a positive relationship between assessed organisational performance factors and e-marketing utilisation especially in MEs. The research assumption that a more intense e-marketing usage is connected with a stronger competitive position is supported by the analysis.

New e-business technologies have increased the ability of online merchants to collect, monitor, target and sell personal information about consumers to third parties. Online consumer privacy, therefore, has attracted the attention of regulators across the globe and poses a significant challenge to online marketers. The FTC has identified five 'core' privacy principles, which are widely accepted by leading countries. With the EU Directive already in force, trust seals and government regulations are the two leading forces pushing for more privacy disclosures. Undoubtedly, privacy should be protected, but the standard applied differs from country to country. Privacy legislation prevalent in the USA and the EU is surveyed in this paper. Currently, the only way consumers can stop the collection of their personal data is to 'opt-out' or configure the browser to reject 'cookies'. We have examined various privacy-enhancing technology solutions but there is no 'single' solution to stop the erosion of privacy in cyberspace. For corporations that collect and use personal information, ignoring privacy legislative and regulatory warning signs can prove to be a costly mistake.

Taking the fact that the internet has greatly levelled the domestic and international marketplace, and many Small- and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) have operated on the internet, it is necessary to examine how assurance seal programmes are perceived in different social environments. Prior research has identified some factors affecting customers' perceptions and attitudes towards assurance seal programmes in developed countries. This research was conducted in Singapore, where the high rate of household access to the internet is mixed with strong social/cultural norms and traditions. The results suggest that assurance seal programmes are effective in addressing privacy dimensions of unfamiliarity, sensitivity, relevance, and usage of information and technology, though in varying degrees. However, using a one-size-fits-all approach to protect online privacy may not be feasible, as respondents did not view that self-regulation could effectively substitute for the role government regulations play.

While setting up web-based stores to target consumers in a new country, an important issue for SME managers is what products to sell in their stores. This is because all products are not likely to succeed equally in all cultural settings. In this context, this paper proposes that SMEs should market hedonic products in those cultures where hedonic shopping motivations are dominant and utilitarian products where utilitarian motivations are dominant. This hypothesis was tested on data that was obtained from a web-based survey. The results of empirical analysis supported the hypothesis.

Knowledge of the stages involved in cyber store development is absent from existing literature, for retail in general and lingerie/fashion in particular. This paper uses a comparative case study approach to inductively conceptualize and contrast the stages involved in the move online (i.e. from website inauguration to profit generation and securing longer-term business value) for an existing high street retailer and a new market entrant in the lingerie/fashion sector. In contrast to existing generic e-business models which dictate either three or four-stage models where profit generation is inconceivable within the first five to seven years online, this paper reports a five-stage e-retail Internet strategy set for profit, where returns on investment are made within 6 months.

Design/methodology/approach - This qualitative critical-case utilizes the in-depth interview technique and rich thematic data analysis to provide insight into e-retail development, with conceptualizations inductively developed from the data. Findings are linked to business growth, e-business strategy, portfolio management and entrepreneurship literatures. Findings - Findings identify a staged, evolutionary approach to transactional cyberstore development and outline 20 key factors for e-retail success. The ""web-weaving"" process is conceptualized: this strategic ""e-portfolio management"" approach identifies a multi-niche opportunity for e-retail, which spreads risk, maximizes revenue streams, utilizes knowledge economies/synergies across multiple-web sites, promotes customer added value and offers potential for competitive advantage and sustainability for the smaller-sized e-retailer. Research limitations/implications - This is an in-depth study of a single, long-standing e-retailer maintaining superior retention levels across an international customer base. That this enterprise bucks current trends by surviving (when 75 per cent e-retail ventures fail) adds validity to web-weaving as a sustainability strategy. Future research should explore this phenomenon within a wider inter/intra-niche context to further contribute to the enhancement of e-retail strategic marketing/enterprise development. Practical implications - Implications indicate that a (niche) e-portfolio strategy is perceived as defensible, from an owner-director perspective, for sustaining a fashion e-retail enterprise. Targeting multiple-niches via ""web-weaving"" provides a clear route to critical-mass and sustainability, which could prove a valuable lesson for many small e-retailers - potentially providing a framework for internet-strategy development in other marketing domains. Originality/value - This research presents a rich picture of how an e-retail enterprise, in a highly competitive/dynamic market, can develop and sustain transactional e-business over the longer-term - presenting obvious implications to SME retail/marketing management. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Electronic commerce; Fashion industry; Internet marketing; Portfolio theory; Small to medium-sized enterprises,,"Ashworth, C.J.; Retail Management Subject Group, Manchester Metropolitan University, Business School, Manchester, United Kingdom; email: C.J.Ashworth@mmu.ac.uk",,,9590552,,,,English,Int.

This lack of skills means that small companies will miss out on new business opportunities (BBC 2000). This is even more evident as regards adopting Internet marketing in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). To improve the situation of the knowledge and skills shortage in SMEs, this paper reports a pilot research project TRIMAR1, which aims to develop a web-based intelligent training system to aid small business employees in their learning and decision-making regarding the use of the Internet as a new marketing medium. TRIMAR attempts to contribute to the wider debate on the content and style of training most suitable to small businesses. It aims to identify the training needs of the small businesses for Internet marketing at a pan-European level and to seek the most effective way to address the training and support needs with web-based systems. Based on a training needs analysis carried out within five European countries: UK, Germany, Poland, Slovak Republic and Portugal, a web based system for gaining Internet marketing knowledge and skills was constructed. The system consists of three major subsystems: Self Assessment Tool (SAT), Training Modules (TM), and a Case Retrieval System (CRS). The self-assessment tool aims to test the users' prior knowledge on Internet marketing and directs them to the appropriate level of training. The training module provides two levels of training: basic and advanced. The advanced level of training is supported with a case base, which contains about seventy case studies on small business Internet marketing implementation. The case retrieval subsystem adopts a case based reasoning approach to help managers to learn and to find solutions from similar cases in previous situations. The system was tested with various users through an online questionnaire. The initial feedback revealed that the case base training approach delivered on the Internet was very welcomed by SMEs.",Case based reasoning; Intelligent web-based training; Internet marketing; SMEs; Training needs analysis,Case based reasoning; Commerce; Decision making; E-learning; Internet; Marketing; Social networking (online); Websites; World Wide Web; Business opportunities; Case-based reasoning approaches; Intelligent training system; Intelligent web; Internet marketing; Small and medium enterprise; SMEs; Training needs analysis; Personnel training,,Remenyi D.,Dechema e.V.,20490992,9.78191E+12,,,English,Proc.

On the one hand, some researchers suggest that because the entry barriers are low, it is cost effective for small businesses to set up an Internet presence, which helps level the playing field between small and large firms [18]; [21]. However, other researchers indicate that ecommerce is not being adopted as readily by small tourism and hospitality businesses as one might have expected [17]; [6]; [31]. Clearly, more research is required in this area regarding Internet usage in small tourism and hospitality businesses.

The initial feedback from users proves using case base reasoning approach is effective, but the quality and the comprehensiveness of case base are key factors for the usefulness of the system. © 2005 by International Federation for Information Processing.",Case based learning; Case-based reasoning; Intelligent web-based training; Internet marketing; SMEs,Commerce; Decision making; E-learning; Managers; Marketing; Personnel training; Websites; Case based learning; Case-base reasonings; Case-based reasoning approaches; Information and Communication Technologies; Intelligent web; Internet marketing; SMEs; Training needs analysis; Case based reasoning,,,Springer New York LLC,18684238,9.78039E+12,,,English,IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,Conference Paper,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902984812,3

Survey data from 1,163 Danish, Finnish, and Swedish manufacturers form the empirical basis for testing the models using LISREL analysis. The results stress that adoption of Internet-based marketing is influenced by willingness to cannibalize, by management support, by market pressure, and by a firm's knowledge of IT. A willingness to cannibalize mediates the effects of future market orientation, ownership, specialized investments, and management support. This is mainly the case in small firms, as the importance of the various drivers and the adoption pattern varies among size categories. Market-pull factors have relatively more explanatory power in medium-sized and large companies. © 2005, IGI Global.

Watson Research Center, New York, NY, United States","E-commerce development and applications have been bringing the Internet to business and marketing and reforming our current business styles and processes. As Business to Business (B2B) has been a main stream of the e-commerce activities for a decade, business to customer (B2C) is still a new area to explore. Among the business to customer activities, a strong impact is security, i.e., how to protect secrets of various parties in business transactions. Different security methods apply to different businesses and meet different customers' needs. The methods with low cost and easy to implement may be less secure, whereas the methods providing high level security can be unaffordable to many small enterprises and individuals. In particular, people, while browsing or surfing on the Web, wish to pay a very small amount and ""buy"" (perhaps just download) an interesting item from the Web. The ""click-and-pay"" or ""click-and-buy"" does not require high security protection and should be convenient to use (buy and pay). Micro-payment issue emerges from the context to meet the need of applicability of low secure and cost in e-purchase. Payments of small amounts may enable many exciting applications on the Internet, such as selling information, small software and services. Users are willing to pay a small amount of money for the information, software and services. While the payment is small, expensive security protection is unnecessary. What users require may include negligible delay, rapid click-through, and automatic billing. Micro-payment is a service intensive activity, where many payment tasks involve different forms of services, such as payment method selection for buyers, security support software, product price comparison, etc. In this paper, we intend to investigate and analyze various aspects of micro-payment system using the web service technology. We will discuss business patterns for micro-payment systems using Web Services approaches. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",,Application programs; Costs; Electronic commerce; Internet; Sales; Websites; Business to business; Business to customers; Business transaction; E-commerce development; Investigate and analyze; Micro-payment systems; Web service technology; Web-services approach; Web services,"Song, W.; Computer Science, Durham University, Durham, United Kingdom; email: w.w.song@dur.ac.uk",,,3029743,,,,English,Lect.

The new spatial possibilities of internet-based technologies provide a powerful route to innovative marketing strategies. Consequently, organisations of all sizes are finding it necessary to establish a web presence to increase their ability to survive in an increasingly dynamic and competitive business environment. Strategically, firms need to be creative and innovative in order to deal effectively with the e-marketing opportunities the internet can deliver. The findings of a comparative study conducted in Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and New Zealand provide evidence of primitive and localised exploitation of the technology, a general lack of enthusiasm about its possibilities, and a perception that there are many barriers to successfully adding value at the customer interface. It is hoped that the somewhat pessimistic tone of the analysis will be taken as an opportunity to win competitive advantage in the knowledge-intensive service sector, rather than a reason to postpone adoption of internet-enabled technology. © 2004, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Electronic commerce; Internet marketing; Marketing models; Small to medium-sized enterprises; Worldwide web,,,,,2634503,,,,English,Mark.

A preliminary test of the model’s theoretical contentions lent support to its overall focus, but found that the firm’s existing learning capabilities were diminished during the adoption of Web-based commerce, and that a lack of vision and prior knowledge produced sub-optimal adoption outcomes. © 2003, MCB UP Limited",Australia; Electronic commerce; Entrepreneurialism; Internet marketing; Market orientation; Small- to medium-sized enterprises,,,,,14626004,,,,English,J.

This study's findings suggest that most firms use the Internet to search for information about customers, distributors, and partners. The Internet does not replace personal sales; most firms reported a rather complex purchasing process and an extensive need for communication with customers before the purchase decision. The authors found standardized products to be most suited for Internet-based sales; however, standardization reduced firms' competitive advantage and profit margins. Software firms' most significant use of the Internet was for postsales service and support activities; these activities both generated revenue and improved customer relations. Partnership agreements with well-known firms, positive product reviews, and image building through the Internet were important to most firms in order to reduce the uncertainty that potential customers often experience when unknown suppliers offer unfamiliar products.

However, the essence of P2P is missed by broad interpretations that do not make it a problem whether to use P2P technology. Incidentally, although marketing activity currently consists mainly of Web pages or mail, it is difficult to actively find latent customers from the company side, and it is not necessarily an effective marketing means for a small-scale company. Therefore, in this paper, we discuss the application of P2P technology to marketing. First, the essence of P2P is correctly extracted by focusing on the state of the information that changes within a P2P network, and effective fields in business are clarified. Next, by paying attention to characteristics of P2P that have not yet been adequately developed in business, we have recognized that P2P marketing is promising from now on. We devise five models for applying P2P networks to the marketing field (P2P marketing), and clarify P2P's marketing features through comparisons with existing Internet marketing. Consequently, we reveal features not currently held by Web pages or mail. © 2003 IEEE.",,Commerce; Distributed computer systems; Marketing; Websites; Effective field; Internet marketing; Marketing activities; Marketing field; Marketing IS; P2P (peer to peer); P2P technologies; Peer to Peer (P2P) network; Peer to peer networks,,Kunii T.L.Sourin A.Soon S.H.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,0769519229; 9780769519227,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

The use of corporate social responsibility appeals, whether espousal of or support for socially salient causes, in the design and execution of marketing communication campaigns is developed. The integration of the Internet and company-sponsored websites into cause-related campaigns is discussed. Principles which may govern the use of causes in Web-based campaigns are introduced and the Web efforts of five well-known companies are reviewed. Twelve recommendations are made regarding the effective use of the Web in cause-related marketing efforts. © 2002 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

The Scottish Borders Council has selected e-procurement as a means to reduce costs, improve process and service delivery, meet Government targets for electronic purchasing and, not least, use e-procurement to assist local businesses in this economically depressed region to become e-commerce capable, thus improving their ability to grow and create wealth and employment in the region. This paper reports the results of research conducted to establish whether recruiting suppliers to e-commerce is likely to be problematic for the Council. Findings show that in terms of connectivity, the Scottish Borders appear ahead of the rest of the UK which is encouraging for the Borders economy and for the Council's e-procurement strategy, although no data is available on actual usage of the Internet, only that the firms have a connection. Fewer of the smaller firms are using the Internet as a marketing tool, that is they do not have even a web site with information only content. The use of ecommerce among Council suppliers is well below the UK average. A number of factors appear to be holding them back.

This can be enhanced through e-commerce and the marketing of product through the Internet to an international audience. Recent research carried out by the Welsh Enterprise Institute (WEI) found that there may only be 10 per cent of Welsh SMAFEs using the Internet for this purpose. The challenge, therefore, is how to enable SMAFEs to market effectively their products; to put these small firms not only in contact with local markets but also international markets; to ensure a range of “authentic” food products is available to Welsh communities in other countries and those people with affinity to “all things Welsh”; and to establish channels that facilitate repeat purchase by visitors to Wales. This challenge can be responded to by enabling SMAFEs to gain access to the Internet and to be confidence in its use, to develop “user friendly” Web sites, to link to overseas markets through the Internet, and to establish a long-term customer base. The WEI has undertaken a two stage survey to measure SMAFE usage of e-mail and the Internet in Wales. The buying habits of Welsh Affinity Groups (WAGs) on the Internet in the USA, Canada and other countries has also been studied and it is planned to establish network links between the SMAFEs and the WAGs, and communities overseas. This paper describes the survey of SMAFEs in Wales and reports on the analysis of the findings together with recommendations for the establishment of a comprehensive Welsh food portal. This is related to the study of the WAGs in the USA and Canada and a proposal for the development of a virtual “market place” between the SMAFEs and the WAGs is explored. The WEI has joined forces with Web design companies WebAware and MAWR Ltd., to offer high quality consultancy and advice to provide Web site and e-commerce solutions relevant to SMAFEs to create an anticipated multi-million pound net gain to Wales and the Welsh Agri-food sector through world-wide sales. A Welsh food portal is therefore of immense importance as a marketing entrepreneurship interfacing tool not only to Agri-food enterprises in Wales but also to customers from across the World. The paper concludes by arguing for the need for appropriate support to be provided for speciality Welsh SMAFEs to make them aware of the importance of the adoption of e-commerce including the Internet and Web sites.

Taking the situation in Australia as an example, the use of the Internet as a promotional tool has not taken hold among small to medium tourism enterprises. It has been suggested that this reluctance to embrace the Internet is due to a range of impediments such as high costs and issues related to adopting new technologies. This paper suggests that a poor understanding of the technology combined with the plethora of jargon and confusing information concerning Internet marketing and promotion is more likely to be the main cause of the slow uptake. This paper also outlines some of the main considerations in developing a site and/or choosing a special-interest site or portal to join.

The Internet is the new information technology trend. Companies are starting to use the Internet as a tool that enables them to promote their products and to find information. The Internet knows no boundaries and it is rapidly becoming the definitive way to make new contacts and develop new markets. The technology can make a small company look very impressive and can also help organisations to develop niche markets. The customer is king. Shopping is an experience that can cause pleasure and pain. For many people nothing will change their need for a trip to the high street or mall. A large number of people buy from catalogues and there is a growing band who can shop from their PC using electronic services. Retailers are always looking at new ways of differentiating themselves from their competitors. Many of them now have Internet sites, each with its own particular focus and aesthetic appeal. Most of these sites are relatively new and therefore retailers have very limited experience of the technology and are just starting to obtain feedback from customers. For them 'interactive' customers are simply viewers of their pages, and feedback coming in the form of orders for products displayed therein. Manufacturers of apparel have had mixed fortunes with Internet marketing. Some made significant investments in the creation of web sites and found the impact on their business was minimal, others (usually the specialist companies that sell direct to the public) fared better. The organisations that have adopted Internet sales services have been the machinery suppliers and those offering goods and services to the sector. To date retailers have not really exploited the full potential of digital technology and many lessons can be learned, not least those from the broadcasting and production industries. There is enormous scope for retailers to become major users of broadband links to home and office, exploiting cable communications in novel ways, each designed to attract customers to their particular goods and services. Other groups such as magazine publishers and show promoters are using the Internet as an additional means of promoting their existing products. Recently there have been new products hitting the market, designed specially for the sector. These centre on up-to-the-minute fashion information including trend forecasting and immediate feedback from shows and shopping centres. Although currently expensive these services are set to change the ways in which information will be delivered to the increasingly global fashion industry.",,internet; marketing; research and development; textile-clothing industry,"Gray, S.; Computer Clothing Research Ctr, Nottingham Trent University, Burton Street, Nottingham NG1 4BU, United Kingdom",The Textile Institute,The textile Institute The Textile Institute,,,,,English,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033051220,2

At the same time, the commercialization of the Internet has created unprecedented opportunities for small businesses to engage in national and international marketing campaigns which could have been unaffordable due to the huge amount of resources required. This paper discusses why the Internet is particularly important for small business international marketing. It then investigates how small business network exchange can be initiated and supported using the Internet, which in turn provides a platform for international marketing. It abo explores strategies for carrying out marketing activities on the Internet, considering the different kinds of inter-organizational relationships that exist within small business networks. Finally, it is argued that marketing is only one aspect of how small business networks can gain strategic advantage in using the Internet. The fundamental issue is to build useful inter-organizational systems to support not only marketing activities among small businesses on the Internet but also to transform activities on different parts of the small business value chain. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,"Poon, S.; School of Information Systems, Swinburne University of Technology, John St. Hawthorn, VIC, Australia",,,0267257X,,,,English,J.
