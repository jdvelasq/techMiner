Kirchhoff SM,56957982400,Advertising industry in the digital age,2011,Advertising: Developments and Issues in the Digital Age,0.0,,"the advertising industry is a major sector of the u.s. economy, employing hundreds of thousands of workers and accounting for about 2% of the nation's annual output, according to some estimates. advertising campaigns by large firms and small businesses provide consumers with product information and generate crucial income for newspapers, television and radio stations, magazines, and other ventures. the advertising industry is in the midst of a fundamental restructuring, however. the deep recession has depressed ad spending. at the same time, the industry faces longer-term challenges as consumers migrate from traditional media to digital platforms such as websites, cell phones, mobile e-readers, and gaming networks. the emerging digital market offers great advantages including lower distribution costs, the ability to target ads to individuals rather than broad groups, and more precise tools to measure ad impact. but the rise of cut-rate online advertising has hurt media companies and businesses that depend on ad revenue. the changing structure of the market is also forcing changes in ad presentation and content, with implications for consumer privacy, internet regulation, and media profitability. u.s. advertising spending declined in 2008. deeper reductions are forecast for 2009. the sharp drop in ad dollars has prompted advertising agencies and media companies to lay off tens of thousands of workers and curtail production. though the market is projected to gradually stabilize, some ad-dependent businesses like newspapers and magazines may not see revenues return to pre-recession levels for years, if then. online advertising has slowed during the recession, though it is expected to claim a growing share of the market over the longer term. internet advertising has nearly doubled since 2005, to about 12% of the market, and some forecasts call for it to more than double again by 2014. digital advertisers are experimenting with a variety of approaches to reach consumers, who are not only dispersed among a multitude of web pages, games, and social networks, but have more power to screen content using pop-up blockers or video recording devices. firms are using ""behavioral advertising"" (tailoring ads to individuals based on technology that tracks their web activities) or, increasingly, marketing on their own websites or through bloggers. the most successful approach to date is ""search"" advertising-where companies like google and yahoo sell ads as part of consumer-initiated information queries on their browsers. search advertising, dominated by a few large firms, accounted for nearly half of digital ad revenues in 2008. the online market is generally compressed, with the top 10 digital ad firms garnering 71% of online revenue in the second quarter of 2009. congress has long regulated advertising to protect consumers and ensure fair competition. lawmakers are now debating whether, or how, to update advertising laws for the internet age, without stifling growth or unduly hurting media outlets dependent on advertising revenue. house members are mulling legislation to enhance privacy rights, which could limit the growth of behavioral advertising. the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) is examining pharmaceutical marketing in social networks and recently set policies for online marketing. the federal trade commission (ftc) has released guidelines calling on bloggers to disclose paid product reviews. other potential issues include looking at advertising in online games and online political advertising.

are web search users disturbed by sponsored links on search engine result pages? how does sponsored search result affect the behavior of the search users? it is necessary to look into these questions and give advices to search engines and advertisers to make sponsored search more useful and acceptable. click-through information is extracted from web access logs collected by a commercial search engine in china. based on analysis into this information, click through behavior on sponsored search results and ordinary results are compared. experimental results show that some hypothesis proposed by previous researches don't accord with practical web user behavior patterns. meanwhile, a number of conclusions are also made to answer these proposed questions",performance analysis;search engine;sponsored search;user log mining;web advertising,behavioral research;business models;click through;explosive growth;information retrieval;internet;internet advertising;market channels;marketing;performance analysis;search engine results;search engines;small scale;sponsored results;sponsored search;sponsored searches;telecommunication networks;user behaviors;user log mining;web access logs;web advertising;web search engines;web searches;web user behaviors;web users;world wide web,Jisuanji Yanjiu yu Fazhan,Article,2,226,4,0.25,china,china,affect;behavior;business model;click through;effectiveness;explosive growth;information;internet advertising;market channels;search engine;search engines;small scale;sponsored results;sponsored search;the internet;web access logs;web search engines;web users,affect;behavior;business model;effectiveness;information;internet advertising;search engine;search engines;small scale;sponsored search;the internet,affect;behavior;click through;effectiveness;explosive growth;internet advertising;market channels;search engines;small scale;sponsored results;sponsored search;web access logs;web search engines;web users,3.0,Tsinghua University CHN;Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology CHN;Tsinghua University CHN,Tsinghua University CHN,performance analysis;search engine;sponsored search;user log mining;web advertising,behavioral research;business model;click through;explosive growth;information retrieval;internet;internet advertising;market channels;market;performance analysis;search engine results;search engine;small scale;sponsored results;sponsored search;sponsored search;telecommunication networks;user behaviors;user log mining;web access logs;web advertising;web search engines;web searches;web user behaviors;web users;world wide web,behavioral research;business models;click through;explosive growth;information retrieval;internet;internet advertising;market channels;marketing;performance analysis;search engine;search engine results;search engines;small scale;sponsored results;sponsored search;sponsored searches;telecommunication networks;user behaviors;user log mining;web access logs;web advertising;web search engines;web searches;web user behaviors;web users;world wide web,behavioral research;business model;click through;explosive growth;information retrieval;internet;internet advertising;market;market channels;performance analysis;search engine;search engine results;small scale;sponsored results;sponsored search;telecommunication networks;user behaviors;user log mining;web access logs;web advertising;web search engines;web searches;web user behaviors;web users;world wide web,affect;behavior;business model;effectiveness;information;internet advertising;search engine;search engine;small scale;sponsored search;the internet,affect;behavior;click through;effectiveness;explosive growth;internet advertising;market channels;search engine;small scale;sponsored results;sponsored search;web access logs;web search engines;web users,affect;behavior;business model;click through;effectiveness;explosive growth;information;internet advertising;market channels;search engine;search engine;small scale;sponsored results;sponsored search;the internet;web access logs;web search engines;web users

Ratajczak E;Pikul-Biniek J,36920983700;57192958424,Management and marketing in the polish sawmilling industry ,2009,Drewno,1.0,"Instytut Technologii Drewna, Poznan, Poland","drivers of changes in the present economic reality are globalization, innovative technologies, competition, and new types of customer behavior. as a result of these processes previous concepts of and methods for company management become insufficient. to gain competitive advantage in the market it is necessary to take more into consideration of such aspects as human resources development, knowledge transfer, and enhancement of customer loyalty. the aim of this article is to present results of research on the changes in the polish sawmilling industry in the field of management, organization, and marketing. surveys and interviews with experts carried out in 2006 and 2008 were main research methods. modern management systems and organizational structures encountered in polish sawmilling companies stem to a great extent from specific features of this industry which encompass great dispersion of and dominance of microenterprises (around 9 thousand business entities, including over 90% with employment of up to 9 people). at the same time this industry is of great economic importance - it produces 9.7% of sold production of traditionally defined wood industry (including furniture) and employs 34 thousand people. after a deep crisis at the end of 1990s the economic situation of the industry improved in the period 2006-2008 - in 2007 the industry was characterized by one of the highest growth dynamics amongst the industries of the wood sector. from conducted research it follows that in the polish sawmilling industry bigger companies, most often having a considerable share of foreign capital, are generally more open to innovative management concepts and techniques. in such companies management is made up of specialist in the field of economics and management more often than in small companies, whereas in smaller firms traditional techniques of company management are used the oftenest, whilst not in all cases this is so because of deliberate action of the management. moreover, generally in microenterprises the owner himself manages the resources of the organization, decides the goals of the enterprise and methods for their attainment. on the basis of research it may be stated that part of sawmilling companies regularly streamline their organizational structures (of over 100 surveyed sawmilling firms every third company streamlined its organizational structure in last 5 years), although this is not a common phenomenon. however in the surveyed companies a centralized decision-making structure is dominant which means that there is lack of characteristic of modern organization “democratization” of management and “flattening” of organizational structures. until now full implementation of such modern concepts as: knowledge management, comprehensive quality management, innovation management, lean management, reengineering, benchmarking, time-based management, or coopetition, was not observed in the polish sawmilling industry. however application of some actions specific to these ideas might be observed. in the context of knowledge management the research showed that not many sawmilling companies have continuous programs of employee training which significantly limits development of these organizations. in the sphere of quality management every third sawmilling company has an organizational unit responsible for quality, which is a positive phenomenon. however still not all the producers see the necessity of having iso certificates. with reference to changes in the innovation sphere it was observed that hardly ever sawmilling companies have in their organization structure units responsible for innovations, r&d, and implementation of new technologies. in recent years new investment have been most often connected with machinery, whereas outlay on purchase of licenses, patents or new technologies has been small. moreover, the research shows that polish sawmills more and more often change their production profile to further processed products of higher added value. post-sale service has also been increasing or its scope has been broadened, which evidences modern approach to management in which the client and his loyalty is the most important. the stronger consumer orientation is reflected mainly by the fact that most sawmilling companies create and maintain a permanent network of consumers and have system of preferences for their regular customers. at the same time product promotion, most often over the internet, is a key marketing technique. this way of communication is most advantageous to big sawmills or sawmills specializing in the production of unique goods. the following factors can be found amongst other factors which have a bearing on winning and keeping the clients: offer of high quality products, low price, unique design, supply on time, and possibility of complaint. however it is a disadvantage that regular marketing research is relatively seldom conducted in sawmilling companies. some other forms of activity characteristic of modern management trends were observed in the sawmilling industry as well. the examples of such activities include: reduction of poduction area and standardization (features of lean management), setting company’s priorities and strategy by comparison with the best companies and adaptation of the model practice (benchmarking), commissioning or subcontracting of selected work packages within the framework of continuous cooperation (outsourcing). on the basis of research and declared intentions of management it may be assumed that in the future the variety and scale of modern management practices application in sawmilling companies will grow.

situation of the knowledge and skills shortage in smes, this paper reports a pilot research project trimar1, which aims to develop a web-based intelligent training system to aid small business employees in their learning and decision-making regarding the use of the internet as a new marketing medium. trimar attempts to contribute to the wider debate on the content and style of training most suitable to small businesses. it aims to identify the training needs of the small businesses for internet marketing at a pan-european level and to seek the most effective way to address the training and support needs with web-based systems. based on a training needs analysis carried out within five european countries: uk, germany, poland, slovak republic and portugal, a web based system for gaining internet marketing knowledge and skills was constructed. the system consists of three major subsystems: self assessment tool (sat), training modules (tm), and a case retrieval system (crs). the self-assessment tool aims to test the users' prior knowledge on internet marketing and directs them to the appropriate level of training. the training module provides two levels of training: basic and advanced. the advanced level of training is supported with a case base, which contains about seventy case studies on small business internet marketing implementation. the case retrieval subsystem adopts a case based reasoning approach to help managers to learn and to find solutions from similar cases in previous situations. the system was tested with various users through an online
