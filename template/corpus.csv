Kshetri N,9633912200,Big data's role in expanding access to financial services in China,2016,International Journal of Information Management,57.0,"Bryan School of Business and Economics, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Bryan Building, P.O. Box 26165, Greensboro, NC  27402 6165, United States","general consumer and business finance companies have had limited success in serving the needs of economically active low-income families and micro-enterprises cost-effectively and sustainably in emerging economies such as china. recent advances in computing and telecommunications technology are dramatically transforming this landscape by changing the way the financial industry operates. a key mechanism underlying this transformation concerns the use of big data in assessing, evaluating and refining the creditworthiness of potential borrowers and reducing the transaction costs. while china's internet-only banking industry is currently small and some activities of players in this industry are akin to those in the shadow banking, this industry has potential to cause a major disruption in the chinese financial market. a main objective of this paper is to examine the role of big data in facilitating the access to financial products for economically active low-income families and micro-enterprises in china. a second objective is to investigate how formal and informal institutions facilitate and constrain the use of big data in the chinese financial industry and market. the paper also investigates how various inherent characteristics of big data - volume, velocity, variety, variability and complexity - are related to the assessment of the creditworthiness of low-income families and micro-enterprises. case studies of big data deployment in the chinese financial industry and market are diskussed. the paper also looks at various categories of personal financial and non-financial information that are being used as proxy measures for a potential borrower's identity, ability to repay and willingness to repay. various business models involving the sources of data (internal vs. external to the big data organization) and providers of credits (big data organization vs. external partners or clients of the big data organization) are investigated. the analysis of the paper indicates that the main reason why low-income families and micro-enterprises in china and other emerging economies lack access to financial services is not because they lack creditworthiness but merely because banks and financial institutions lack data, information and capabilities to access the creditworthiness of and effectively provide financial services to this financial disadvantaged group.

Bennett M,56039069400,The financial industry business ontology: Best practice for big data,2013,Journal of Banking Regulation,31.0,"EDM Council, Financial Industry Business Ontology (FIBO), United Kingdom","this article describes the financial industry business ontology (fibo) as a set of formal models that define unambiguous shared meaning for financial industry concepts. an account is given of the history and development of the fibo series of standards and the theoretical underpinnings of these as a business or 'conceptual' model. some initial proof of concept work is described, demonstrating how in addition to the use of fibo as a conceptual model, it is possible to derive semantic technology-based applications that may be used to carry out novel types of processing on data. the development roadmap of the fibo series of standards within the object management group is also described, so that readers can have an idea of what to expect from fibo and when.

Aitken R,24469548000,'All data is credit data': Constituting the unbanked,2017,Competition and Change,30.0,"University of Alberta, Department of Political Science, Edmonton, AB  T6G 2R3, Canada","global financial and data capitalism has constituted new forms of knowledge, novel inscriptions which make that knowledge tangible and new ways of visualizing sources of value and profit. this paper examines a cluster of new practices designed to make visible - and extract value from - those without formal credit scores in contemporary financial markets. many 'financial inclusion' projects now attempt to score the 'credit invisible' by drawing on a range of alternative data - non-financial payment streams, academic records, behavioral signals gleaned from online or social media footprints and results generated via digitized psychometric testing - and by assessing that data in relation to models of risk assessment based on the analysis of big data. i argue in this paper that these experiments in alternative credit scoring constitute the unbanked as an important, and dubious, category of knowledge and intervention. i also argue that attempts to score the unbanked offer a revealing glimpse of many of the social and political limitations associated with projects of 'inclusion'. although often imagined as forms of pristine incorporation, inclusion projects often constitute troubling new kinds of social sorting and segmentation.

(2) as for research about investors’ sentiments on the basis of internet big data, the main methods of sentiment analysis include building an inventory of lexical categories, using dictionaries for analysis of lexical categories, and machine learning. (3) many studies address whether internet big data can predict capital markets. however, they reach no consistent conclusions, which could be due to limitations of sample and analysis method used. (4) data collection technique and analysis methods require further improvements.

Onay C;Ozturk E,54881274800;57203431415,A review of credit scoring research in the age of Big Data,2018,Journal of Financial Regulation and Compliance,7.0,"Department of MIS, Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey","purpose: this paper aims to survey the credit scoring literature in the past 41 years (1976-2017) and presents a research agenda that addresses the challenges and opportunities big data bring to credit scoring. design/methodology/approach: content analysis methodology is used to analyze 258 peer-reviewed academic papers from 147 journals from two comprehensive academic research databases to identify their research themes and detect trends and changes in the credit scoring literature according to content characteristics. findings: the authors find that credit scoring is going through a quantitative transformation, where data-centric underwriting approaches, usage of non-traditional data sources in credit scoring and their regulatory aspects are the up-coming avenues for further research. practical implications: the paper’s findings highlight the perils and benefits of using big data in credit scoring algorithms for corporates, governments and non-profit actors who develop and use new technologies in credit scoring. originality/value: this paper presents greater insight on how big data challenges traditional credit scoring models and addresses the need to develop new credit models that identify new and secure data sources and convert them to useful insights that are in compliance with regulations.

Gonzalez Canche MS,54890793700,Geographical network analysis and spatial econometrics as tools to enhance our understanding of student migration patterns and benefits in the U.S. higher education network,2018,Review of Higher Education,6.0,"The University of Pennsylvania, United States","this study measures the extent to which student outmigration outside the 4-year sector takes place and posits that the benefits from attracting non-resident students exist regardless of sector of enrolllment. the study also provides empirical evidence about the relevance of employing geographical network analysis (gna) and spatial econometrics in [higher] education research. when applied to student migration, gna enabled the visualization and analysis of complex (virtuous cyclical) dynamics in non-resident student exchanges. findings revealed that states’ preponderance in attract ing non-resident students is both explained by their propensity to export their resident students out-of-state while it simultaneously affected non-resident tuition variation.

Werner M,56799013500,Process model representation layers for financial audits,2016,Proceedings of the Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences,5.0,"Auckland University of Technology, New Zealand",business processes play a significant role in financial audits. they are carried out by auditors who require diverse information for this purpose. process mining techniques offer new opportunities to exploit data from erp systems to generate reliable process models very effectively and efficiently. traditional process models are only suited to provide information on a single process. this study illustrates how diverse information aspects that are required for process audits can be provided to the auditor by using different process model types that relate to different representation layers. process mining techniques commonly operate on the business process and instance level. this study introduces process map and process stream models as higher level abstractions of multiple business processes. the introduction of higher-level process models in combination with traditional model types allows an all-encompassing representation of information aspects that are relevant for process audits in the context of financial audits. ,big data analytics;business process modeling;design science;erp systems;financial audits;process mining,big data;business process model;data analytics;data mining;design;design science;enterprise resource planning;erp system;finance;financial audits;process mining;systems engineering,"(2012) Identifying and Assessing the Risks of Material Misstatement Through Understanding the Entity and Its Environment, , IFAC, ISA 315 (Revised); Werner, M., Gehrke, N., Nuttgens, M., Business process mining and reconstruction for financial audits (2012) Proceedings of the 45th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS 2012), Maui, pp. 5350-5359; De Leoni, M., Van Der Aalst, P.W.M., Data-aware process mining: Discovering decisions in processes using alignments (2013) 28th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing, pp. 1454-1461. , Coimbra, Portugal; Rozinat, A., De Medeiros, A.K.A., Gunther, C.W., Weijters, A., Van Der Aalst, P.W.M., The need for a process mining evaluation framework in research and practice (2008) Business Process Management Workshops, pp. 84-89; Muller-Wickop, N., Schultz, M., Peris, M., Towards key concepts for process audits-a multi-method research approach (2013) Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Enterprise Systems, Accounting and Logistics, , Utrecht; Van Der Aalst, P.W.M., (2011) Process Mining: Discovery, Conformance and Enhancement of Business Processes, , 1st Edition.

Gollapudi S,56572374300,Aggregating financial services data without assumptions: A semantic data reference architecture,2015,"Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE 9th International Conference on Semantic Computing, IEEE ICSC 2015",5.0,"Architecture CoE, Broadridge Financial Solutions (India) Pvt. Ltd, Hyderabad, Telangana, 500081, India","we are seeing a sea change down the pike in terms of financial information aggregation and consumption; this could potentially be a game changer in financial services space with focus on ability to commoditize data. financial services industry deals with a tremendous amount of data that varies in its structure, volume and purpose. the data is generated in the ecozystem (its customers, its own accounts, partner trades, securities transactions etc.), is handled by many systems - each having its own perspective. front-office systems handle transactional behavior of the data, middle office systems which typically work with a drop-copy of the data subject it to intense processing, business logic, computations (such as inventory positions, fee calculations, commissions) and the back office systems deal with reconciliation, cleansing, exception management etc. then there are the analytic systems which are concerned with auditing, compliance reporting as well as business analytics. data that flows through this ecozystem gets aggregated, transformed, and transported time and again. traditional approaches to managing such data leverage extract-transform-load (etl) technologies to set up data marts where each data mart serves a specific purpose (such as reconciliation or analytics). the result is proliferation of transformations and marts in the organization. the need is to have architectures and it systems that can aggregate data from many such sources without making any assumptions on how, where or when this data will be used. the incoming data is semantically annotated and stored in the triple store within storage tier and offers the ability to store, query and draw inferences using the ontology. there is a probable need for a big data solution here that helps ease data liberation and co-location. this paper is a summary of one such business case of the financial services industry where traditional etl silos was broken to support the structurally dynamic, ever expanding and changing data usage needs employing ontology and semantic techniques like rdf/rdfs, sparql, owl and related stack.

AtlantTIC Research Centre, University of Vigo, Pontevedra, 36310, Spain","the dawn of big data has seen the volume, variety, and velocity of data sources increase dramatically. enormous amounts of structured, semi-structured and unstructured heterogeneous data can be garnered at a rapid rate, making analysis of such big data a herculean task. this has never been truer for data relating to financial stock markets, the biggest challenge being the 7vs of big data which relate to the collection, pre-processing, storage and real-time processing of such huge quantities of disparate data sources. data fusion techniques have been adopted in a wide number of fields to cope with such vast amounts of heterogeneous data from multiple sources and fuse them together in order to produce a more comprehensive view of the data and its underlying relationships. research into the fusing of heterogeneous financial data is scant within the literature, with existing work only taking into consideration the fusing of text-based financial documents. the lack of integration between financial stock market data, social media comments, financial diskussion board posts and broker agencies means that the benefits of data fusion are not being realized to their full potential. this paper proposes a novel data fusion model, inspired by the data fusion model introduced by the joint directors of laboratories, for the fusing of disparate data sources relating to financial stocks. data with a diverse set of features from different data sources will supplement each other in order to obtain a smart data layer, which will assist in scenarios such as irregularity detection and prediction of stock prices.

Politou E;Alepis E;Patsakis C,57210613315;57211584454;24402834800,Profiling tax and financial behavior with big data under the GDPR,2019,Computer Law and Security Review,3.0,"Department of Informatics, University of Piraeus, Greece","big data and machine learning algorithms have paved the way towards the bulk accumulation of tax and financial data which are exploited to either provide novel financial services to consumers or to augment authorities with automated conformance checks. in this regard, the international and eu policies toward collecting and exchanging a large amount of personal tax and financial data to facilitate innovation and to promote transparency in the financial and tax domain have been increased substantially over the last years. however, this vast collection and utilization of “big” tax and financial data raise also considerations around privacy and data protection, especially when these data are fed to clever algorithms to build detailed personal profiles or to take automated decisions which may exceptionally affect people's lives. ultimately, these practices of profiling tax and financial behavior provide fertile ground for diskriminating processing of individuals and groups. in light of the above, this paper aims to shed light on the following four interdependent and highly disputed areas: firstly, to review the most well-known profiling and automated decision risks emerged from big data technology and machine learning algorithmic processing as well as to analyze their impact on the tax and financial privacy rights through their immense profiling practices; secondly, to document the current eu initiatives toward financial and tax transparency, namely the aeoi, psd2, mifid2, and data retention policies, along with their implications for personal data protection when used for profiling and automated decision purposes; thirdly, to highlight the way forward for mitigating the risks of profiling and automated decision in the big data era and to investigate the protection of individuals against these practices in the light of the new technical and legal frameworks; in this respect, we finally delve into the regulatory eu efforts towards fairer and accountable profiling and automated decision processes, and in particular we examine the extent to which the gdpr provisions establishes a protection regime for individuals against advanced profiling techniques, enabling thus accountability and transparency.

Manning School of Business, University of Massachusetts Lowell, Lowell, MA, United States","purpose: this paper aims to diskuss the application of big data analytics to the brainstorming session in the current auditing standards. design/methodology/approach: the authors review the literature related to fraud, brainstorming sessions and big data, and propose a model that auditors can follow during the brainstorming sessions by applying big data analytics at different steps. findings: the existing audit practice aimed at identifying the fraud risk factors needs enhancement, due to the inefficient use of unstructured data. the brainstorming session provides a useful setting for such concern as it draws on collective wisdom and encourages idea generation. the integration of big data analytics into brainstorming can broaden the information size, strengthen the results from analytical procedures and facilitate auditors’ communication. in the model proposed, an audit team can use big data tools at every step of the brainstorming process, including initial data collection, data integration, fraud indicator identification, group meetings, conclusions and documentation. originality/value: the proposed model can both address the current issues contained in brainstorming (e.g. low-quality diskussions and production blocking) and improve the overall effectiveness of fraud detection.

Jin Y;Zhang S(1),57202573824;57043649200,Credit rationing in small and micro enterprises: A theoretical analysis,2019,Sustainability (Switzerland),2.0,"School of Public Policy and Administration, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710049, China","one of the features of credit markets is that borrowers are sometimes rationed in the amount that they can borrow, which differentiates them from other markets. small and micro enterprises (smes) are more likely to be eliminated than large and medium-sized enterprises under credit rationing. however, smes play a significant role in employment creation and growth of gross domestic products in developing countries. so, it is of great significance to study the reasons why smes are more vulnerable to credit constraints. by considering the differences in characteristics between smes and large and medium-sized enterprises, we established a theoretical model with endogenous enterprise size, and by considering banks' screening principles before and after the loan approval, we have analyzed the micro-mechanism in which there are significant differences in credit availability between smes and large and medium-sized enterprises. our conclusion indicates that credit rationing in smes is the result of the rational choice by banks for the purpose of profit maximization.

Risk Management, Voya Investment Management, Atlanta, GA  30327, United States; Department of Computer Science, Georgia State University, Atlanta, 30062, United States","the 2008 financial crisis which created a global financial market meltdown is mainly due to badly structured mortgage loans with poor or subpar credit quality and lack of proper tools to measure portfolio risks by the lenders. even though several problems led to this crisis, we looked at this from a big data. had the infrastructure and analytical analysis tools were present to the lenders, they would have found the various early warning signs on these mortgage loans and could have better prepared for the crisis. aftermath of the crisis, all the big financial institutions took a fresh look and embarked onto build various tools and frameworks to address this big data in their portfolios with data driven analysis. the 3vs (velocity, volume and variety) of the big data in our mortgage loan analysis system challenges our traditional approach in collecting, processing and presenting the individual and aggregated loan level data in a meaningful format to facilitate our portfolio managers in decision making. the traditional methods are implemented on a standalone on-premises sql server. our framework creates the foundation of migrating from traditional standalone database architecture (on-premises) to cloud computing environment using “script based implementation”. the methods we present are simple but effective and saves resources in terms of hardware, software and on-going maintenance costs. big data “capture, transform, calculate and visualize” (ctcv) implementation takes a phased approach rather than a big bang model. our implementation helps the big data management to be part of organizational tool kit. this saves hard dollars and brings us in line with the overall firm strategic vision of moving to cloud computing for investment management services.

Ethical implications for the information systems diskipline",2017,Social Epistemology,2.0,"Management, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand; Marketing and Management, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia; Business, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia","the question we pose in this paper is: how can wisdom and its inherent drive for integration help information systems in the development of practices for responsibly and ethically managing and using big data, ubiquitous information and algorithmic knowledge and so make the world a better place? we use the recent financial crises to illustrate the perils of an overreliance on and misuse of data, information and predictive knowledge when global information systems are not wisely integrated. our analysis shows that the global financial crisis was in part caused by a serious lack of integration of information with the larger context of social, cultural, economic and political dynamics. integration of all the variables in a global and information hungry industry is exceptionally difficult, and so “exceptionality” of some kind is needed to make sufficient integration happen. wisdom, we suggest, is the exceptionality needed to lead successful integration. we expect that a wisdom-based shift can lead to more organizationally effective and socially responsible information systems.

Rosamond E,56960374900,"To sort, to match and to share: addressivity in online dating platforms",2018,Journal of Aesthetics and Culture,1.0,"Visual Cultures, Goldsmiths, University of London, London, United Kingdom","this paper analyzes addressivity in online dating platforms, with okcupid as its focus. drawing from mikhail bakhtin’s theory of addressivity, i argue the need for a generic account of online dating—one that focuses on the particular kinds of address that typify expressive scenarios on its platforms. rather than focusing solely on how users address themselves to other users, i instead examine several layers of addressivity within the online dating scenario: (1) users addressing other users, (2) users addressing platforms, (3) platforms addressing publics, (4) companies addressing investors, and (5) investors addressing users. i argue that within surveillance capitalism generally, and within online dating platforms in particular, there is an imbalance of addressivity: though online users are broadly aware that their data may be collected and analyzed, they are nonetheless unconscious of and/or uncomfortable with this form of sharing, because it does not easily fit into previously known narratives of dating. in other words, the automatic gathering and analysis of data by okcupid is a background condition of all its users’ activity—but this is not sufficiently accounted for in users’ generic understandings of online dating. okcupid cofounder christian rudder’s continual efforts to make online dating data analytics both understandable and palatable for users (via okcupid’s promotional material, ted-ed talks, a blog and a book on data) aims, in part, to address this imbalance. these stagings of the platform’s address to its users aim to garner interest in, and acceptance of, becoming part of aggregated, privatized data sets—and indeed, coming to be witnessed and assetized by the automated gaze of data analytics.

Vernadskogo, Moscow, 119454, Russian Federation","the article deals with the behavioral mechanisms of functioning of modern financial market. author points out to the formation of a permanent latent information asymmetry as well as fragmentation of information preferences of different investors' groups. this leads to concentration of ""bid data"" and related technologies with the professional market participants. however, such intellectualization of financial transactions does not preclude the investors from fallacy in asset selection and financial losses. laypersons as well as professionals continue to follow their subjective motivations (gut feelings, intuition) and all of them are proving to be irrational. author cites the results of studies showing that overconfidence of professionals worsens their investment results. meantime, non-professional retail investors can not only move the market prices, but also outperform the professionals. the likelihood that professionals will outperform laypersons in all financial transactions is doubtful. this behavior increases overall market uncertainty and reduces the accuracy of market forecasts. author agrees with conclusions of western researchers that irrational behavior of professional well-informed investors may reduce negative impact of information asymmetry on the non-professional and not informed investors. under these conditions, the development of ""big data"" processing and analyzing technologies cannot radically change the behavior of investors and increase the rationality of the financial market. however, penetration of mobile technologies in capital markets can increase the ability of retail investors to monitor the market as well as their ability to select assets. these technologies may help principals in agent-principal relations to protect their interests. a for the pro essional investors and financial institutions, ""big data"" helps them to establish more flexible and friendly client relation with retail customers. still, the author concludes that the basic financial market paradigm is not yet to be revised",big data;financial market;latent information asymmetry;uncertainty,,"Nazaruk, A., Rauchman, M., Big Data in Capital Markets, , http://www.sigmod.org/2013/keynote_1.shtml, ACM SIGMOD/PODS Conference, 2013, June 22-27, New York (accessed 25.10.2016); The Future of Financial Services.

Canhoto AI,8832560400,Leveraging machine learning in the global fight against money laundering and terrorism financing: An affordances perspective,2020,Journal of Business Research,0.0,"Brunel Business School, Brunel University London, Kingston Lane, Uxbridge, Middlesex  UB8 3PH, United Kingdom","financial services organizations facilitate the movement of money worldwide, and keep records of their clients’ identity and financial behavior. as such, they have been enlisted by governments worldwide to assist with the detection and prevention of money laundering, which is a key tool in the fight to reduce crime and create sustainable economic development, corresponding to goal 16 of the united nations sustainable development goals. in this paper, we investigate how the technical and contextual affordances of machine learning algorithms may enable these organizations to accomplish that task. we find that, due to the unavailability of high-quality, large training datasets regarding money laundering methods, there is limited scope for using supervised machine learning. conversely, it is possible to use reinforced machine learning and, to an extent, unsupervised learning, although only to model unusual financial behavior, not actual money laundering.

Qin C,57219311752,Analysis of the Mechanism of Financing Constraints Affecting Financial Flexibility Based on Big Data,2020,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,0.0,"Academy of Professional Degree Education, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China","according to relevant data satellite research samples of chinese listed companies from 2012 to 2017, starting from the concept of big data, this paper chooses appropriate samples and carries out big data research on financing flexibility affecting financial flexible management from different angles. in the current paper, we diskuss in detail how corporate financial flexibility is affected by financing constraints and financial development levels. the study found that, on the one hand, financial flexibility is largely influenced by the degree of financing constraints; on the other hand, if there is a relatively high degree of financial constraints, it will lead to higher financial flexibility. in addition, if there are differences in the level of financial development in each region, there may be a certain degree of financial risk. financing constraints have different effects on the financial flexibility of listed companies. for regions with a high degree of financial development, this impact is less pronounced. if the region in which it is located has a relatively low level of financial development, the impact will be very large. for a situation with a high degree of financing constraints, it will correspond to higher financing flexibility.

Ferretti F,56234851600,"Not-so-big and big credit data between traditional consumer finance, FinTechs, and the banking union: Old and new challenges in an enduring EU policy and legal conundrum",2018,Global Jurist,0.0,"Brunel University London, Kingston Lane, Uxbridge, UB8 3PH, United Kingdom","this paper diskusses the role and usage of traditional and non-traditional consumer data in the retail financial markets of the european union in the context of the economic theories, policies, and law within which they work. across europe there is no common practice of using the credit data of consumers, which can be exploited for several purposes. traditionally, they are used by the lending industry as a risk-management tool to underwrite borrowing decisions or price risks, but they can also be used as a practice of creditworthiness assessment. in some member states, consumer data are part of a broader information centralisation system for the prudential supervision of banks and the financial system as a whole. within this already complex picture, emerging technologies and the processing of new generations of personal data are starting to give way to new business models that can transform retail financial markets (fintechs). whatever the function the data perform, their source, type, breath, and depth differ greatly from country to country. unlike for the harmonization of eu rules on credit to consumers for the creation of the internal market, the underlying consumer data infrastructure remains fragmented at national level, failing to achieve univocal, common, or defined policy objectives under a harmonized legal framework. likewise, the establishment of the banking union and the prudential supervision of the euro-area demand standardization and convergence of the data used to measure debt levels, arrears, and delinquencies. the many functions and different usages of credit data suggest that the policy goals to be achieved should inform the design and structure of the databases, as well as the role, legal, and institutional framework of the organizations managing the data system (the data brokers). this is also because fundamental rights and consumer protection concerns arise from the dissemination and sharing of traditional and non-traditional data, as well as from their expanding uses. this is an area of the eu internal market that demands the attention of the eu legislator without further delays.
