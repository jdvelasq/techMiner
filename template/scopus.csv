HML-Opt has been designed to provide a flexible framework where a researcher can define the space of possible pipelines to solve a specific machine learning problem, which can range from high-level decisions about representation and features to low-level hyper-parameter values. The evaluation of HML-Opt is presented via two different case studies, both of which demonstrate that it is competitive with existing AutoML tools on a variety of benchmarks. Furthermore, HML-Opt can be applied to novel problems, such as knowledge extraction from natural language text, whereas other techniques are insufficiently flexible to capture the complexity of these scenarios. The source code for HML-Opt is available online for the research community. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","AutoML; Evolutionary computation; Grammatical evolution; Natural language processing; Supervised learning","Computational grammars; Machine learning; Flexible framework; Grammatical evolution; Hyper-parameter; Knowledge extraction; Machine learning problem; Natural language text; Optimisations; Research communities; Pipelines","Assuncao, F., Lourenco, N., Machado, P., Ribeiro, B., Automatic generation of neural networks with structured Grammatical Evolution (2017), 2017 IEEE Congr.

Traditional indicators of sepsis exhibit poor performance when used in this unique population due to their underlying hypermetabolic and inflammatory response following burn injury. To address this challenge, we developed the Machine Intelligence Learning Optimizer (MILO), an automated machine learning (ML) platform, to automatically produce ML models for predicting burn sepsis. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 211 adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) with severe burn injury (≥ 20% total body surface area) to generate training and test datasets for ML applications. The MILO approach was compared against an exhaustive “non-automated” ML approach as well as standard statistical methods. For this study, traditional multivariate logistic regression (LR) identified seven predictors of burn sepsis when controlled for age and burn size (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.99–4.04, P = 0.032). The area under the ROC (ROC-AUC) when using these seven predictors was 0.88. Next, the non-automated ML approach produced an optimal model based on LR using 16 out of the 23 features from the study dataset. Model accuracy was 86% with ROC-AUC of 0.96. In contrast, MILO identified a k-nearest neighbor-based model using only five features to be the best performer with an accuracy of 90% and a ROC-AUC of 0.96. Machine learning augments burn sepsis prediction. MILO identified models more quickly, with less required features, and found to be analytically superior to traditional ML approaches. Future studies are needed to clinically validate the performance of MILO-derived ML models for sepsis prediction. © 2020, The Author(s).",,,"Greenhalgh, D.G., Saffle, J.R., Holmes, J.H., 4th, Gamelli, R.L., Palmieri, T.L., Horton, J.W., American Burn Association consensus conference to define sepsis and infection in burns (2007) J.

The goal of the architecture is to reduce the implementation effort for the usage of artificial intelligence algorithms. The core of the CAAI is a cognitive module that processes the user’s declarative goals, selects suitable models and algorithms, and creates a configuration for the execution of a processing pipeline on a big data platform. Constant observation and evaluation against performance criteria assess the performance of pipelines for many and different use cases. Based on these evaluations, the pipelines are automatically adapted if necessary. The modular design with well-defined interfaces enables the reusability and extensibility of pipeline components. A big data platform implements this modular design supported by technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Kafka for virtualization and orchestration of the individual components and their communication. The implementation of the architecture is evaluated using a real-world use case. The prototypic implementation is accessible on GitHub and contains a demonstration. © 2020, The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence; AutoML; Big data platform; Cognition; CPPS; Industry 4.0; Modularization; Optimization; Reference architecture; SMBO","Big data; Cognitive systems; Cyber Physical System; Pipelines; Reusability; Artificial intelligence algorithms; Cognitive architectures; Declarative goals; Individual components; Models and algorithms; Performance criterion; Pipeline component; Production system; Artificial intelligence","Adolphs, P., (2015) Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI4.0), , https://www.zvei.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Themen/Industrie_4.0/Das_Referenzarchitekturmodell_RAMI_4.0_und_die_Industrie_4.0-Komponente/pdf/5305_Publikation_GMA_Status_Report_ZVEI_Reference:Architecture_Model.pdf, Tech. rep., VDI; Anderson, J.R., ACT: A simple theory of complex cognition (1996) Am Psychol, 51 (4), pp. 355-365. , . 10.1037/0003-066X.51.4.355; (2020) Benchmarking in Optimization: Best Practice and Open Issues; Bartz-Beielstein, T., Gentile, L., Zaefferer, M., (2017) In a Nutshell: Sequential Parameter Optimization; Bartz-Beielstein, T., Zaefferer, M., Model-based methods for continuous and discrete global optimization (2017) Appl Soft Comput, 55, pp. 154-167. , . 10.1016/j.asoc.2017.01.039; Bauer, K., Diemer, J., Hilger, C., Löwen, U., Michels, J.S., (2017) Benefits of Application Scenario Value-Based Service, , https://www.plattform-i40.de/PI40/Redaktion/DE/Downloads/Publikation/benefits-application-scenario.pdf?_blob=publicationFile&v=7, Tech. rep., Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi), Accessed: 2020-02-18; Breiman, L., Random forests (2001) Mach Learn, 45 (1), pp. 5-32; Bunte, A., Fischbach, A., Strohschein, J., Bartz-Beielstein, T., Faeskorn-Woyke, H., Niggemann, O., Evaluation of cognitive architectures for cyber-physical production systems (2019) 24Nd IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA), pp. 729-736. , https://doi.org/10.1109/ETFA.2019.8869038, Zaragoza, Spain; Bunte, A., Niggemann, O., Stein, B., Integrating owl ontologies for smart services into automationml and opc ua (2018) 23Rd IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA), pp. 1383-1390. , https://doi.org/10.1109/ETFA.2018.8502593, Turin, Italy; Bunte, A., Wunderlich, P., Moriz, N., Li, P., Mankowski, A., Rogalla, A., Niggemann, O., Why symbolic ai is a key technology for self-adaption in the context of cpps (2019) 24Nd IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA), Zaragoza, Spain, pp. 1701-1704. , https://doi.org/10.1109/ETFA.2019.8869082; (2020) Schema Management, , https://docs.confluent.io/current/schema-registry/index.html, Accessed: 2020-02-18; Drath, R., Horch, A., Industrie 4.0: Hit or hype?

The recent advances in ML and AI make the efficacy of CAPTCHAs in strengthening Internet services against bots questionable. In this paper, we conduct a systematic analysis and classification of the state-of-the-art ML-based techniques for the automated text-based CAPTCHA breaking problem. The current state and robustness of text-based CAPTCHAs as are utilized by modern Internet applications, against ML-based automated breaking tools, is examined and reported. Our study suggests that ML can be very effective in increasing: (a) accuracy, (b) speed, and (c) abstraction in CAPTCHA solving. Especially, as far as (c) is concerned, ML-based techniques are easier to be applied in different classes of text-based CAPTCHA schemes. To assess the importance of ML in breaking CAPTCHAs, we build our own ML-only classifiers. Surprisingly, an ML-only approach for solving CAPTCHAs is not sufficient. Overall, our study suggests that fundamentally different ways of conducting reverse Turing test, that will be painless for legitimate users (i.e., humans) but at the same time challenging for automated systems (i.e., software), should be considered for ensuring the healthy operation of current Internet services. © 2020","CAPTCHA; Deep learning; Systemization of knowledge; Web attacks; Web security","Automation; Electronic mail filters; Machine learning; Software testing; Text processing; Automated machines; Automated systems; Internet application; Internet services; Legitimate users; Reverse turing test; State of the art; Systematic analysis; Web services","Abhishek, L.K., Thinning approach in digital image processing (2017) Special Issue - SACAIM, pp. 326-330. , 10.21172; Ahmad, A.S.E., Yan, J., Marshall, L., The robustness of a new captcha (2010) Proceedings of the Third European Workshop on System Security, pp. 36-41. , ACM; Ahmad, A.S.E., Yan, J., Tayara, M., The robustness of Google CAPTCHA's (2011), Computing Science, Newcastle University; Ahn, L., Blum, M., Hopper, N.J., Langford, J., Captcha: using hard ai problems for security (2003) International Conference on the Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques, pp. 294-311. , Springer; Al-Fannah, N.M., Making defeating captchas harder for bots (2017) CoRR; Avyuct, P., (2019), b., Avyuct Generative adversarial networks (GANs): A step to AI algorithms; Baecher, P., Fischlin, M., Gordon, L., Langenberg, R., Ltzow, M., Schrder, D., Captchas: the good, the bad, and the ugly (2010) Sicherheit 2010.

Traditional road condition monitoring is regularly conducted by specially designed instrumented vehicles, which requires time and money and is only able to cover a limited proportion of the road network. In light of the ubiquitous use of smartphones, this paper proposes an automatic pothole detection system utilizing the built-in vibration sensors and global positioning system receivers in smartphones. We collected road condition data in a city using dedicated vehicles and smartphones with a purpose-built mobile application designed for this study. A series of processing methods were applied to the collected data, and features from different frequency domains were extracted, along with various machine-learning classifiers. The results indicated that features from the time and frequency domains outperformed other features for identifying potholes. Among the classifiers tested, the Random Forest method exhibited the best classification performance for potholes, with a precision of 88.5% and recall of 75%. Finally, we validated the proposed method using datasets generated from different road types and examined its universality and robustness. © 2020 by the authors.

Automated machine learning (AutoML) systems such as the Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT) constitute an appealing approach to this end. However, in biomedical data, there are often baseline characteristics of the subjects in a study or batch effects that need to be adjusted for in order to better isolate the effects of the features of interest on the target. Thus, the ability to perform covariate adjustments becomes particularly important for applications of AutoML to biomedical big data analysis. Results: We developed an approach to adjust for covariates affecting features and/or target in TPOT. Our approach is based on regressing out the covariates in a manner that avoids 'leakage' during the cross-validation training procedure. We describe applications of this approach to toxicogenomics and schizophrenia gene expression data sets. The TPOT extensions discussed in this work are available at https://github.com/EpistasisLab/tpot/tree/v0.11.1-resAdj. Conclusions: In this work, we address an important need in the context of AutoML, which is particularly crucial for applications to bioinformatics and medical informatics, namely covariate adjustments. To this end we present a substantial extension of TPOT, a genetic programming based AutoML approach. We show the utility of this extension by applications to large toxicogenomics and differential gene expression data. The method is generally applicable in many other scenarios from the biomedical field. © 2020 The Author(s).","AutoML; Covariate adjustment; Feature importance; Genetic programming; Pathways","Big data; Bioinformatics; Gene expression; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Machine learning; Medical informatics; Predictive analytics; Automated machines; Biomedical fields; Cross validation; Differential gene expressions; Gene Expression Data; Pipeline optimization; Predictive modeling; Training procedures; Trees (mathematics)","Olson, R.S., Urbanowicz, R.J., Andrews, P.C., Lavender, N.A., Kidd, L.C., Moore, J.H., Automating biomedical data science through tree-based pipeline optimization (2016) Applications of Evolutionary Computation, pp. 123-137. , G.

The process from idea to code and then to experiment may require up to thousands of iterations to find the optimum set of hyper-parameters. Also, it is hard to find best machine learning techniques for a given dataset. The WOLF framework has been designed to simultaneously automate the process of selecting the best algorithm and searching for the optimum hyper-parameters. It can be useful to both who are novice in machine learning and just want to find best algorithm for their dataset, and also to those who are experts in the field and want to compare their new features or algorithm with state of the art techniques. By incorporating the WOLF framework in their designs, it is easier for novices to apply machine learning techniques on their dataset. With a wide range of evaluation metrics provided, WOLF also helps data scientists to develop better intuition towards machine learning techniques and speed up the process of algorithm development. Another main feature of the WOLF framework is that user can easily integrate new algorithms at any stage of the machine learning pipeline. In this paper, we present the WOLF architecture, and demonstrate how it could be used for standard machine learning datasets and for Android malware detection tasks. Experimental results show the flexibility and performance of WOLF. © 2020 ACM.","Classifier; Malware detection; Parameter selection","Iterative methods; Learning algorithms; Malware; Work simplification; Algorithm development; Automated machines; Evaluation metrics; Machine learning techniques; Malware detection; Real-world problem; State-of-the-art techniques; Workflow managements; Machine learning","Sutskever A Krizhevsky, I., Hinton, G., (2012); Andrychowicz, M., Denil, M., Gómez Colmenarejo, S., Hoffman, M.W., Pfau, D., Schaul, T., Shillingford, B., De Freitas, N., Learning to learn by gradient descent by gradient descent (2016) Proceedings of the 30th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (Barcelona, Spain) (NIPS'16), pp. 3988-3996. , Curran Associates Inc., Red Hook, NY, USA; Arp, D., Spreitzenbarth, M., Huebner, M., Gascon, H., Rieck, K., Drebin: Efficient and explainable detection of android malware in your pocket (2014) 21st Annual Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS); Berthold, M.R., Cebron, N., Dill, F., Gabriel, T.R., Kötter, T., Meinl, T., Ohl, P., Wiswedel, B., The konstanz information miner (knime) (2008) Data Analysis, Machine Learning and Applications.

One of the progressing works for automated machine learning improvement is the inclusion of evolutionary algorithm such as Genetic Programming. The function of Genetic Programming is to optimize the best combination of solutions from the possible pipelines of machine learning modelling, including selection of algorithms and parameters optimization of the selected algorithm. As a family of evolutionary based algorithm, the effectiveness of Genetic Programming in providing the best machine learning pipelines for a given problem or dataset is substantially depending on the algorithm parameterizations including the mutation and crossover rates. This paper presents the effect of different pairs of mutation and crossover rates on the automated machine learning performances that tested on different types of datasets. The finding can be used to support the theory that higher crossover rates used to improve the algorithm accuracy score while lower crossover rates may cause the algorithm to converge at earlier stage. © 2020, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

However, from the vast extent of possible ML algorithms, which one is the optimal model to predict the target variable? What are the hyperparameters for such a model? Given the plethora of possible answers to these questions, in the last years, automated ML (autoML) has been gaining attention. Here, we apply an autoML library called Tree-based Pipeline Optimisation Tool (TPOT) which uses a tree-based representation of ML pipelines and conducts a genetic programming-based approach to find the model and its hyperparameters that more closely predicts the subject's true age. To explore autoML and evaluate its efficacy within neuroimaging data sets, we chose a problem that has been the focus of previous extensive study: brain age prediction. Without any prior knowledge, TPOT was able to scan through the model space and create pipelines that outperformed the state-of-the-art accuracy for Freesurfer-based models using only thickness and volume information for anatomical structure. In particular, we compared the performance of TPOT (mean absolute error [MAE]: 4.612 ±.124 years) and a relevance vector regression (MAE 5.474 ±.140 years). TPOT also suggested interesting combinations of models that do not match the current most used models for brain prediction but generalise well to unseen data. AutoML showed promising results as a data-driven approach to find optimal models for neuroimaging applications. © 2020 The Authors.

The application of machine learning algorithms to TBM performance prediction creates several challenges. Such prediction is a nontrivial task involving procedures such as data preprocessing, selection of a machine learning algorithm and optimization of the related hyperparameters. The demand for expert knowledge has restricted the application of machine learning methods to TBM performance prediction, and it is meaningful to study predicting TBM performance automatically. In this paper, we explore three approaches to TBM performance prediction using Bayesian optimization and automated machine learning (AutoML). In the first study, Bayesian optimization is used to determine the optimal hyperparameters of various machine learning algorithms, including support vector regression (SVR), decision tree, bagging tree, random forest and AdaBoost. We attain the minimum mean squared error (MSE) values of 3.135×10-2 and 3.177×10-2 for a decision tree and SVR, respectively. In the second approach called the neural architecture search (NAS), the optimal combination of architecture, hyperparameters and the training procedure of an artificial neural network is found in a single operation. We obtain the optimal results of 3.514×10-2 and 3.237×10-2 if complete and simplified NAS are used, respectively. In the third method, the best combination of a data preprocessing method, a machine learning model and the related hyperparameters is found, and an optimal MSE value of 3.148×10-2 is obtained using AutoML. In all three studies, we obtain state-of-the-art prediction results that are superior to a previous best prediction result of 3.500×10-2. The prediction results prove that Bayesian optimization and AutoML are powerful tools that can not only effectively predict TBM performance but also reduce the demand for expert knowledge of machine learning. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bayesian optimization; Machine learning; Performance prediction","Adaptive boosting; Boring machines (machine tools); Construction equipment; Decision trees; Forecasting; Mean square error; Network architecture; Predictive analytics; Support vector regression; Bayesian optimization; Machine learning methods; Machine learning models; Minimum mean squared error; Neural architectures; Performance prediction; Support vector regression (SVR); Tunnel boring machine(TBM); Machine learning; algorithm; Bayesian analysis; machine learning; optimization; prediction; TBM; tunneling","Adoko, A.C., Gokceoglu, C., Yagiz, S., Bayesian prediction of TBM penetration rate in rock mass (2017) Eng.

Excellent hand-crafted CNN architectures incorporated the wisdom of human experts, which is an important reason for CNNs success. However, the design of architectures is a difficult problem, which needs a lot of professional knowledge as well as computational resources. Moreover, the manually designed architecture might be suboptimal, because it is only one of the thousands of unobserved but objective existed paths. Considering that the success of deep learning is largely due to its automation of the feature engineering process, how to design automatic architecture search methods to replace the hand-crafted ones is an interesting topic. In this article, the application of neural architecture search (NAS) in the PolSAR area is explored for the first time. Different from the utilization of existing methods, a PolSAR-Tailored Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) method, called PDAS, is proposed in order to adapt NAS to the PolSAR classification. A PolSAR-Tailored search space and an improved one-shot search strategy are equipped with the proposed method. By PDAS, the architecture (corresponds to the hyperparameter but not the topology) parameters can be optimized with high efficiency by a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method. The optimized architecture parameters should be transformed into corresponding architecture and retrained to achieve classification. In addition, a complex-valued PDAS (CVPDAS) is developed to fit the data form of PolSAR images so as to improve the performance. Experiments on three benchmark data sets show that the architectures obtained by searching have better classification performance than hand-crafted ones. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Automatic machine learning (AutoML); convolutional neural network (CNN); neural architecture search (NAS); polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) classification","Architecture; Benchmarking; Classification (of information); Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Gradient methods; Image enhancement; Network architecture; Optimization; Stochastic systems; Synthetic aperture radar; Classification performance; Computational resources; Feature engineerings; Neural architectures; Optimized architectures; Polarimetric synthetic aperture radars; Professional knowledge; Stochastic gradient descent; Image classification; artificial neural network; automation; design; image classification; PALSAR; satellite imagery","Cameron, W.L., Leung, L.K., Feature motivated polarization scattering matrix decomposition (1990) Proc Ieee Int.

The aging process significantly affects most of the above characteristics making the development of a reliable method of age prediction very important. Today, the so-called “epigenetic clocks” represent the most accurate models for age prediction. Since they are technically not achievable in a typical forensic laboratory, forensic DNA technology has triggered efforts toward the simplification of these models. The present study aimed to build an epigenetic clock using a set of methylation markers of five different genes in a sample of the Italian population of different ages covering the whole span of adult life. In a sample of 330 subjects, 42 selected markers were analyzed with a machine learning approach for building a prediction model for age prediction. A ridge linear regression model including eight of the proposed markers was identified as the best performing model across a plethora of candidates. This model was tested on an independent sample of 83 subjects providing a median error of 4.5 years. In the present study, an epigenetic model for age prediction was validated in a sample of the Italian population. However, its applicability to advanced ages still represents the main limitation in forensic caseworks. © 2020 American Academy of Forensic Sciences","age prediction; automated machine learning; ELOVL2; epigenetic clock; externally visible characteristics; FDP; methylation",,"Kayser, M., Forensic DNA henotyping: predicting human appearance from crime scene material for investigative purposes (2015) Forensic Sci Int Genet, 18, pp. 33-48; Kayser, M., de Knijff, P., Improving human forensics through advances in genetics, genomics and molecular biology (2011) Nat Rev Genet, 12 (3), pp. 179-192; Kayser, M., Schneider, P.M., DNA-based prediction of human externally visible characteristics in forensics: motivations, scientific challenges, and ethical considerations (2009) Forensic Sci Int Genet, 3 (3), pp. 154-161; Jylhava, J., Pedersen, N.L., Hagg, S., Biological age predictors (2017) EBioMedicine, 21, pp. 29-36; Horvath, S., Oshima, J., Martin, G.M., Lu, A.T., Quach, A., Cohen, H., Epigenetic clock for skin and blood cells applied to Hutchinson Gilford Progeria Syndrome and ex vivo studies (2018) Aging (Albany N Y), 10 (7), pp. 1758-1775; Hannum, G., Guinney, J., Zhao, L., Zhang, L., Hughes, G., Sadda, S., Genome-wide methylation profiles reveal quantitative views of human aging rates (2013) Mol Cell, 49 (2), pp. 359-367; Bekaert, B., Kamalandua, A., Zapico, S.C., Van de Voorde, W., Decorte, R., Improved age determination of blood and teeth samples using a selected set of DNA methylation markers (2015) Epigenetics, 10 (10), pp. 922-930; Bocklandt, S., Lin, W., Sehl, M.E., Sanchez, F.J., Sinsheimer, J.S., Horvath, S., Epigenetic predictor of age (2011) PLoS One, 6 (6); Garagnani, P., Bacalini, M.G., Pirazzini, C., Gori, D., Giuliani, C., Mari, D., Methylation of ELOVL2 gene as a new epigenetic marker of age (2012) Aging Cell, 11 (6), pp. 1132-1134; Giuliani, C., Cilli, E., Bacalini, M.G., Pirazzini, C., Sazzini, M., Gruppioni, G., Inferring chronological age from DNA methylation patterns of human teeth (2016) Am J Phys Anthropol, 159 (4), pp. 585-595; Lee, H.Y., Jung, S.E., Oh, Y.N., Choi, A., Yang, W.I., Shin, K.J., Epigenetic age signatures in the forensically relevant body fluid of semen: a preliminary study (2015) Forensic Sci Int Genet, 19, pp. 28-34; Naue, J., Hoefsloot, H.C.J., Mook, O.R.F., Rijlaarsdam-Hoekstra, L., van der Zwalm, M.C.H., Henneman, P., Chronological age prediction based on DNA methylation: massive parallel sequencing and random forest regression (2017) Forensic Sci Int Genet, 31, pp. 19-28; Park, J.L., Kim, J.H., Seo, E., Bae, D.H., Kim, S.Y., Lee, H.C., Identification and evaluation of age-correlated DNA methylation markers for forensic use (2016) Forensic Sci Int Genet, 23, pp. 64-70; Zbiec-Piekarska, R., Spolnicka, M., Kupiec, T., Makowska, Z., Spas, A., Parys-Proszek, A., Examination of DNA methylation status of the ELOVL2 marker may be useful for human age prediction in forensic science (2015) Forensic Sci Int Genet, 14, pp. 161-167; Zbiec-Piekarska, R., Spolnicka, M., Kupiec, T., Parys-Proszek, A., Makowska, Z., Paleczka, A., Development of a forensically useful age prediction method based on DNA methylation analysis (2015) Forensic Sci Int Genet, 17, pp. 173-179; Freire-Aradas, A., Phillips, C., Lareu, M.V., Forensic individual age estimation with DNA: from initial approaches to methylation tests (2017) Forensic Sci Rev, 29 (2), pp. 121-144; Weidner, C.I., Lin, Q., Koch, C.M., Eisele, L., Beier, F., Ziegler, P., Aging of blood can be tracked by DNA methylation changes at just three CpG sites (2014) Genome Biol, 15 (2), p.

Rapid and accurate classification of ovarian cancer plays an important role in the determination of treatment plans and prognoses. Nevertheless, the most commonly used classification method is based on histopathological specimen examination, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Thus, in this study, we utilize radiomics feature extraction methods and the automated machine learning tree-based pipeline optimization tool (TOPT) for analysis of 3D, second harmonic generation images of benign, malignant and normal human ovarian tissues, to develop a high-efficiency computer-aided diagnostic model. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.98, 0.96 and 0.94 were obtained, respectively, for the classification of the three tissue types. Furthermore, this approach can be readily applied to other related tissues and diseases, and has great potential for improving the efficiency of medical diagnostic processes. © 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, without arduous manual effort, this deep quantization can lead to significant accuracy loss, leaving it in a position of questionable utility. We propose a systematic approach to tackle this problem, by automating the process of discovering the bitwidths through an end-to-end deep reinforcement learning framework (ReLeQ). This framework utilizes the sample efficiency of proximal policy optimization to explore the exponentially large space of possible assignment of the bitwidths to the layers. We show how ReLeQ can balance speed and quality, and provide a heterogeneous bitwidth assignment for quantization of a large variety of deep networks with minimal accuracy loss ($\leq$ ≤ 0.3% loss) while minimizing the computation and storage costs. With these DNNs, ReLeQ enables conventional hardware and custom DNN accelerator to achieve $~2.2\times$ 2. 2 × speedup over 8-bit execution. © 1981-2012 IEEE.","autoML; Neural networks; quantization","Deep neural networks; Network coding; Neural networks; Reinforcement learning; Accuracy loss; Encodings; End to end; Large spaces; Policy optimization; Quantization levels; Reinforcement learning approach; Storage costs; Deep learning","LeCun, Y., Bengio, Y., Hinton, G.E., Deep learning (2015) Nature, 521 (7553), pp. 436-444; Zhou, S., Ni, Z., Zhou, X., Wen, H., Wu, Y., Zou, Y., DoReFa-Net: Training low bitwidth convolutional neural networks with low bitwidth gradients (2016) CoRR; Zhu, C., Han, S., Mao, H., Dally, W.J., Trained ternary quantization (2017) Proc.

Building a high quality machine learning model to be deployed in production is a challenging task, from both, the subject matter experts and the machine learning practitioners. For a broader adoption and scalability of machine learning systems, the construction and configuration of machine learning workflow need to gain in automation. In the last few years, several techniques have been developed in this direction, known as AUTOML. In this paper, we present a two-stage optimization process to build data pipelines and configure machine learning algorithms. First, we study the impact of data pipelines compared to algorithm configuration in order to show the importance of data preprocessing over hyperparameter tuning. The second part presents policies to efficiently allocate search time between data pipeline construction and algorithm configuration. Those policies are agnostic from the metaoptimizer. Last, we present a metric to determine if a data pipeline is specific or independent from the algorithm, enabling fine-grain pipeline pruning and meta-learning for the coldstart problem. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","AutoML; CASH; Data pipelines; Hyperparameter tuning","Machine learning; Optimization; Pipelines; Algorithm configurations; AutoML; CASH; Data pipelines; Hyper-parameter; Machine learning models; Machine learning techniques; Two stage optimizations; Learning algorithms","Elshawi, R., Maher, M., Sakr, S., Automated machine learning: State-of-the-art and open challenges (2019); Hutter, F., Kotthoff, L., Vanschoren, J., Automatic machine learning: methods, systems, challenges (2019) Challenges Mach.

Emergent DNN hardware accelerators begin to support flexible bitwidth (1–8 bits) to further improve the computation efficiency, which raises a great challenge to find the optimal bitwidth for each layer: it requires domain experts to explore the vast design space trading off accuracy, latency, energy, and model size, which is both time-consuming and usually sub-optimal. There are plenty of specialized hardware accelerators for neural networks, but little research has been done to design specialized neural networks optimized for a particular hardware accelerator. The latter is demanding given the much longer design cycle of silicon than neural nets. Conventional quantization algorithm ignores the different hardware architectures and quantizes all the layers in a uniform way. In this paper, we introduce the Hardware-Aware Automated Quantization (HAQ) framework which automatically determine the quantization policy, and we take the hardware accelerator’s feedback in the design loop. Rather than relying on proxy signals such as FLOPs and model size, we employ a hardware simulator to generate the direct feedback signals to the RL agent. Compared with other conventional methods, our framework is fully automated and can specialize the quantization policy for different neural network architectures and hardware architectures. Our framework effectively reduced the latency by 1.4–1.95 × and the energy consumption by 1.9 × with negligible loss of accuracy compared with the fixed bitwidth (8 bits) quantization. Our framework reveals that the optimal policies on different hardware architectures (i.e., edge and cloud architectures) under different resource constraints (i.e., latency, energy and model size) are drastically different. We interpreted the implication of different quantization policies, which offer insights for both neural network architecture design and hardware architecture design. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Automated ML;

Existing approaches optimize a pipeline of pre-processing, feature engineering, model selection and hyperparameter optimization, and assume that the user is fully aware of the choice of the underlying metric (such as precision, recall or F1-measure). However, end-users are often unaware of the actual implications of choosing a metric, as the resulting models often significantly vary in their predictions. In this work, we propose a framework to personalise AutoML for individual end-users by learning a designated ranking model from pairwise user preferences and using the latter as the metric function for state-of-the-art AutoML systems. Given a set of possible metrics, we generate candidate models by repeatedly running AutoML with combinations of the former and have the user choose between pairs of resulting models. We use RankNet to learn a personalized ranking function for the end-user, which is used as loss function for final run of a standard AutoML system. To evaluate our proposed framework we define three preferences a user could pursue and show that a ranking model is able to learn these preferences from pairwise comparisons. Furthermore, by changing the metric function of AutoML we show that a personalized preference is able to improve machine learning pipelines. We evaluated the ability of learning a personalized preference and the entire framework on several OpenML multi-class classification datasets. © 2020 The authors and IOS Press.",,"Classification (of information); Learning to rank; Pipelines; Precision engineering; Automated machines; Feature engineerings; Hyper-parameter optimizations; Machine learning models; Multi-class classification; Pair-wise comparison; Predictive performance; Ranking functions; Learning systems","Burges, C.C.J., Ragno, R., Viet Le, Q., Learning to rank with nonsmooth cost functions (2006) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 19, pp. 193-200. , Proceedings of the Twentieth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, December 4-7, 2006, eds., Bernhard Schölkopf, John C.

As essential legal documents, contracts are subject to negotiations, demanding extensive analysis and evaluation efforts. Although the emergence of machine learning has enabled assistance tools for text analysis tasks, the specificity and constraints of each business context remain obstacles for the automation of contracts evaluation. In this paper, we propose an AutoML based approach for automated negotiation assistance that uses expert annotated contracts and the business-specific knowledge of acceptance policies. Driven by policies rules, our approach generates a classification process composed of hierarchies of complementary classifiers, each being automatically prepared according, but not limited to, feature extraction, learning model and data granularity. Experiments conducted on real-world service contracts have yielded promising results. © 2020 The authors and IOS Press.",,"Contracts; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Acceptance policies; Analysis and evaluation; Automated negotiations; Business contexts; Classification process; Data granularity; Service contract; Specific knowledge; Artificial intelligence","Harkous, H., Fawaz, K., Lebret, R., Schaub, F., Shin, K.G., Aberer, K., Polisis: Automated analysis and presentation of privacy policies using deep learning (2018) 27th USENIX Security Symposium, USENIX Security 2018, pp. 531-548. , Baltimore, MD, USA., August; He, Y., Li, J., Song, Y., He, M., Peng, H., Time-evolving text classification with deep neural networks (2018) The 27th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, IJCAI-18, pp. 2241-2247. , July; Isa, D., Lee, L., Kallimani, V., RajKumar, R., Text document preprocessing with the bayes formula for classification using the support vector machine (2008) IEEE Trans.

Rather than relying on human time/effort and manual experimentation, models can be improved by simply letting the AutoML system run for more time. In this hands-on tutorial, we demonstrate fundamental techniques that enable powerful AutoML. We consider standard supervised learning tasks on various types of data including tables, text, images, as well as multi-modal data comprised of multiple types. Rather than technical descriptions of how individual ML models work, we emphasize how to best use models within an overall ML pipeline that takes in raw training data and outputs pre-dictions for test data. A major focus of our tutorial is on automating deep learning, a class of powerful techniques that are cumbersome to manage manually. Despite this, hardly any educational material describes their successful automation. Each topic covered in the tutorial is accompanied by a hands-on Jupyter notebook that implements best practices (which will be available on Github before and after the tutorial).

We proposeAutoGrow to automate depth discovery in DNNs: starting from a shallow seed architecture,AutoGrow grows new layers if the growth improves the accuracy; otherwise, stops growing and thus discovers the depth. We propose robust growing and stopping policies to generalize to different network architectures and datasets. Our experiments show that by applying the same policy to different network architectures,AutoGrow can always discover near-optimal depth on various datasets of MNIST, FashionMNIST, SVHN, CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet. For example, in terms of accuracy-computation trade-off,AutoGrow discovers a better depth combination in \resnets than human experts. OurAutoGrow is efficient.

One of the most challenging tasks in this field is the automatic generation of end-to-end ML pipelines: combining multiple types of ML algorithms into a single architecture used for analysis of previously-unseen data. This task has two challenging aspects: the first is the need to explore a large search space of algorithms and pipeline architectures. The second challenge is the computational cost of training and evaluating multiple pipelines. In this study we present DeepLine, a reinforcement learning-based approach for automatic pipeline generation. Our proposed approach utilizes an efficient representation of the search space together with a novel method for operating in environments with large and dynamic action spaces. By leveraging past knowledge gained from previously-analyzed datasets, our approach only needs to generate and evaluate few dozens of pipelines to reach comparable or better performance than current state-of-the-art AutoML systems that evaluate hundreds and even thousands of pipelines in their optimization process. Evaluation on 56 classification datasets demonstrates the merits of our approach. © 2020 ACM.","AutoML; classification; deep reinforcement learning","Classification (of information); Data mining; Knowledge management; Pipelines; Reinforcement learning; Turing machines; Automatic Generation; Automatic machines; Classification datasets; Computational costs; Dynamic actions; Multiple pipelines; Pipeline architecture; State of the art; Deep learning","Anthony, T., Tian, Z., Barber, D., Thinking fast and slow with deep learning and tree search (2017) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 5360-5370; Bello, I., Zoph, B., Vasudevan, V., Le, Q.V., Neural optimizer search with reinforcement learning (2017) Proceedings of the 34th International Conference on Machine Learning-Volume 70.

With new pipeline components comes a combinatorial explosion in the number of choices In this work, we design a new AutoML system TensorOboe to address this challenge: an automated system to design a supervised learning pipeline. TensorOboe uses low rank tensor decomposition as a surrogate model for efficient pipeline search. We also develop a new greedy experiment design protocol to gather information about a new dataset efficiently.

Deep neural networks are being increasingly used for these recommendation problems. These models use embeddings to represent discrete items as continuous vectors, and the vocabulary sizes and embedding dimensions, despite their heavy influence on the model's accuracy, are often manually selected in a heuristical manner. We present Neural Input Search (NIS), a technique for learning the optimal vocabulary sizes and embedding dimensions for categorical features. The goal is to maximize prediction accuracy subject to a constraint on the total memory used by all embeddings. Moreover, we argue that the traditional Single-size Embedding (SE), which uses the same embedding dimension for all values of a feature, suffers from inefficient usage of model capacity and training data. We propose a novel type of embedding, namely Multi-size Embedding (ME), which allows the embedding dimension to vary for different values of the feature. During training we use reinforcement learning to find the optimal vocabulary size for each feature and embedding dimension for each value of the feature. Experimentation on two public recommendation datasets shows that NIS can find significantly better models with much fewer embedding parameters. We also deployed NIS in production to a real world large scale App ranking model in our company's App store, Google Play, resulting in +1.02% App Install with 30% smaller model size. © 2020 Owner/Author.","automl; embeddings; recommendation models","Deep learning; Deep neural networks; E-learning; Embeddings; Learning to rank; Optimization; Reinforcement learning; Categorical features; Embedding dimensions; Embedding parameters; Optimal vocabulary; Prediction accuracy; Ranking model; Technology industry; Vocabulary size; Data mining","Bansal, T., Belanger, D., McCallum, A., Ask the gru: Multi-task learning for deep text recommendations (2016) Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (Boston, Massachusetts, USA) (RecSys '16), pp. 107-114. , https://doi.org/10.1145/2959100.2959180, ACM, New York, NY, USA; Bender, G., Kindermans, P., Zoph, B., Vasudevan, V., Le, Q., Understanding and simplifying one-shot architecture search (2018) Proceedings of the 35th International Conference on Machine Learning (Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, 80, pp. 550-559. , Jennifer Dy and Andreas Krause (Eds.).

Recently, many deep neural network models have been proposed to make accurate prediction. However, manually designing neural networks requires amount of expert efforts and ST domain knowledge. How to automatically construct a general neural network for diverse spatio-temporal predication tasks in cities? In this paper, we study Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for spatio-temporal prediction and propose an efficient spatio-temporal neural architecture search method, entitled AutoST. To our best knowledge, the search space is an important human prior to the success of NAS in different applications while current NAS models concentrated on optimizing search strategy in the fixed search space. Thus, we design a novel search space tailored for ST-domain which consists of two categories of components: (i) optional convolution operations at each layer to automatically extract multi-range spatio-temporal dependencies; (ii) learnable skip connections among layers to dynamically fuse low- and high-level ST-features. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-word spatio-temporal prediction tasks, including taxi flow and crowd flow, showing that the learned network architectures can significantly improve the performance of representative ST neural network models. Furthermore, our proposed efficient NAS approach searches 8-10x faster than state-of-the-art NAS approaches, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of AutoST. © 2020 ACM.","AutoML; neural architecture search;

Such emplacement at shallow depth leads in doming of the overburden, which acts as plausible structural traps useful for hydrocarbon exploration. The petroliferous Canterbury Basin, SE offshore New Zealand, is a classic example of such phenomena, where saucer-shaped magmatic sills are emplaced within the Cretaceous to Eocene succession. This has resulted into forced folds and hydrothermal vents above the sill terminations within the Eocene sequences. The present study attempts to capture this scenario through a neural network by designing meta-attributes, called as the Sill Cube (SC) and Fluid Cube (FC). The meta-attributes are computed by unifying different seismic attributes that are trained over interpreter's knowledge on the geologic targets following a supervised scheme of neural learning. The approach prominently arrests the structural geometry of sill complexes and fluxed-out magmatic fluids within the Cretaceous to Eocene strata from 3D seismic reflection data of the Waka prospect, offshore Canterbury Basin. Based on the meta-attribute interpretation, the individual sills within the Waka prospect cover areas of ~1.5 km2 to 17 km2, where the principal sills namely the Sill W1 and Sill W2 spread over an area of ~12 km2 and 17 km2, respectively. Moreover, the fluxed out magmatic fluids vertically rise to a height of ~800 m through hydrothermal vents from the tip of the principal sills, and uplift the overburden. Such approach is automated and incorporates interpreter's acquaintances to effectively capture subsurface magmatic activities for better interpretation of 3D seismic data. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Canterbury Basin; Meta-attributes; Neural network; Sills","Complex networks; Digital storage; Hot springs; Machine learning; Offshore oil well production; Sedimentology; Seismic prospecting; Seismic waves; Seismology; Automated machines; Hydrocarbon exploration; Hydrothermal vent; Magmatic activity; Sedimentary basin; Sedimentary strata; Seismic attributes; Structural geometry; Offshore petroleum prospecting; data interpretation; emplacement; hydrothermal vent; machine learning; magma; overburden; sedimentary basin; sill; transport process; uplift; Canterbury Basin; Canterbury [South Island]; New Zealand; South Island","Alves, T.M., Omosanya, K.D., Gowling, P., Volume rendering of enigmatic high-amplitude anomalies in Southeast Brazil: a workflow to distinguish lithologic features from fluid accumulations (2015) Interpretation, 3, pp. A1-A14; Aminzadeh, F., de Groot, P., An Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks.

The purpose of this paper is to choose RE that fits best from a set of candidate solutions using rule-based automated machine learning (ML) approach. The objective is to draw trustworthy conclusion, which results in brand building, and establishing a reliable relation with customers and undeniably to grow the business. Design/methodology/approach: An experimental quantitative research method was conducted in which the ML model was evaluated with diversified performance metrics and five RE algorithms by combining offline evaluation on historical and simulated movie data set, and the online evaluation on business-alike near-real-time data set to uncover the best-fitting RE. Findings: The rule-based automated evaluation of RE has changed the testing landscape, with the removal of longer duration of manual testing and not being comprehensive. It leads to minimal manual effort with high-quality results and can possibly bring a new revolution in the testing practice to start a service line “Machine Learning Testing as a service” (MLTaaS) and the possibility of integrating with DevOps that can specifically help agile team to ship a fail-safe RE evaluation product targeting SaaS (software as a service) or cloud deployment. Research limitations/implications: A small data set was considered for A/B phase study and was captured for ten movies from three theaters operating in a single location in India, and simulation phase study was captured for two movies from three theaters operating from the same location in India. The research was limited to Bollywood and Ollywood movies for A/B phase, and Ollywood movies for simulation phase. Practical implications: The best-fitting RE facilitates the business to make personalized recommendations, long-term customer loyalty forecasting, predicting the company's future performance, introducing customers to new products/services and shaping customer's future preferences and behaviors. Originality/value: The proposed rule-based ML approach named “2-stage locking evaluation” is self-learned, automated by design and largely produces time-bound conclusive result and improved decision-making process. It is the first of a kind to examine the business domain and task of interest. In each stage of the evaluation, low-performer REs are excluded which leads to time-optimized and cost-optimized solution. Additionally, the combination of offline and online evaluation methods offer benefits, such as improved quality with self-learning algorithm, faster time to decision-making by significantly reducing manual efforts with end-to-end test coverage, cognitive aiding for early feedback and unattended evaluation and traceability by identifying the missing test metrics coverage. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Automated recommender engine evaluation; Machine learning in software testing; Personalization; Recommendation system; Recommender engine; Recommender engine evaluation metrics",,"Andjelkovic, I., Parra, D., O'Donovan, J., Moodplay: interactive music recommendation based on Artists' mood similarity (2019) International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 121, pp. 142-159; Beel, J., Langer, S., A comparison of offline evaluations, online evaluations, and user studies in the context of research-paper recommender systems (2015) International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries, pp. 153-168. , Springer, Cham; Bhaumik, R., Mobasher, B., Burke, R., A clustering approach to unsupervised attack detection in collaborative recommender systems (2011) Proceedings of the International Conference on Data Mining (DMIN) (p. 1).

With the wide availability of data and the increasing capacity of computing resources, they triggered a new era of state-of-the-art results in diverse directions. However, building neural network models is domain-specific, and figuring out the best architecture and hyper-parameters in each problem is still an art. In practice, it is a highly iterative process that is very time-consuming, requires substantial computing resources, and needs deep knowledge and solid technical skills. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a new gradient-based technique, AutoDLCon, that aims to automate the design process of neural network architecture for the given classification task and dataset within a specified time budget using a controller neural network. In particular, the controller network predicts how good a model is and suggests trying an optimized model by back-propagating from a loss function through the controller network to the controller's weights one time and to the controller's inputs at another time. This approach mimics the exploration of the search space in a more efficient way by reducing the number of trials to the minimum. As a consequence, it can significantly reduce the time budget and computing resources to a minimum and controllable level. We evaluate our approach using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets with different settings based on the difficulty of the problem. The results of our experiments show that our approach is able to generate child models that are good enough to obtain competitive results on the validation data after only a few trials. © 2020 IEEE.","AutoML; Backpropagation; Neural Networks; Optimization","Arts computing; Big data; Budget control; Classification (of information); Controllers; Deep learning; Iterative methods; Network architecture; Automated tuning; Classification tasks; Computing resource; Increasing capacities; Iterative process; Learning network; Neural network model; Optimized models; Neural networks","Voulodimos, A., Doulamis, N., Doulamis, A., Protopapadakis, E., Deep learning for computer vision: A brief review (2018) Comp.

The centrosome, comprised of two centrioles surrounded by the pericentriolar material (PCM), is the cell's central MT-organizing center. Centrosomes in cancer cells are commonly numerically amplified. However, the question of how the amplification of centrosomes alters MT organization capacity is not well studied. We developed a quantitative image-processing and machine learning-aided approach for the semi-automated analysis of MT organization. We designed a convolutional neural network-based approach for detecting centrosomes, and an automated pipeline for analyzing MT organization around centrosomes, encapsulated in a semi-automatic graphical tool. Using this tool, we find that breast cancer cells with supernumerary centrosomes not only have more PCM protein per centrosome, which gradually increases with increasing centriole numbers, but also exhibit expansion in PCM size. Furthermore, cells with amplified centrosomes have more growing MT ends, higher MT density and altered spatial distribution of MTs around amplified centrosomes. Thus, the semi-automated approach developed here enables rapid and quantitative analyses revealing important facets of centrosomal aberrations. © 2020.

They typically represent users and items in a low-dimensional embedding space and then feed the embeddings into the following deep network structures for prediction. Traditional deep recommender models often adopt uniform and fixed embedding sizes for all the users and items. However, such design is not optimal in terms of not only the recommendation performance and but also the space complexity. In this paper, we propose to dynamically search the embedding sizes for different users and items and introduce a novel embedding size adjustment policy network (ESAPN). ESAPN serves as an automated reinforcement learning agent to adaptively search appropriate embedding sizes for users and items. Different from existing works, our model performs hard selection on different embedding sizes, which leads to a more accurate selection and decreases the storage space. We evaluate our model under the streaming setting on two real-world benchmark datasets. The results show that our proposed framework outperforms representative baselines. Moreover, our framework is demonstrated to be robust to the cold-start problem and reduce memory consumption by around 40%-90%. The implementation of the model is released. © 2020 ACM.","AutoML; embedding; recommender system","Recommender systems; Reinforcement learning; Benchmark datasets; Cold start problems; Low dimensional embedding; Memory consumption; Network structures; Recommendation performance; Reinforcement learning agent; Space complexity; Embeddings","Brock, A., Lim, T., Ritchie, J.M., Weston, N., (2017) Smash: One-Shot Model Architecture Search Through Hypernetworks, , arXiv preprint, 2017; Chang, S., Zhang, Y., Tang, J., Yin, D., Chang, Y., Hasegawa-Johnson, M.A., Huang, T.S., Streaming recommender systems (2017) Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web, Www 2017, pp. 381-389. , https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052627, Perth, Australia, April 3-7, 2017; Chen, J., Zhang, H., He, X., Nie, L., Liu, W., Chua, T.-S., Attentive collaborative fltering: Multimedia recommendation with item-And component-level attention (2017) Proceedings of the 40th International Acm Sigir Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pp. 335-344; Cheng, H.-T., Koc, L., Harmsen, J., Shaked, T., Chandra, T., Aradhye, H., Anderson, G., Shah, H., Wide & deep learning for recommender systems (2016) Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on Deep Learning for Recommender Systems, DLRS@RecSys 2016, pp. 7-10. , https://doi.org/10.1145/2988450.2988454, Boston, MA, USA, September 15, 2016; Cheng, H.-T., Koc, L., Harmsen, J., Shaked, T., Chandra, T., Aradhye, H., Anderson, G., Ispir, M., Wide & deep learning for recommender systems (2016) Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on Deep Learning for Recommender Systems, pp. 7-10. , ACM; Hidasi, B., Karatzoglou, A., Baltrunas, L., Tikk, D., (2015) Session-Based Recommendations with Recurrent Neural Networks, , arXiv preprint, 2015; Joglekar, M.R., Li, C., Adams, J.K., Khaitan, P., Le, Q.V., Neural input search for large scale recommendation models (2019) CoRR, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04471, abs/1907.04471 2019); Joglekar, M.R., Li, C., Adams, J.K., Khaitan, P., Le, Q.V., (2019) Neural Input Search for Large Scale Recommendation Models, , arXiv preprint, 2019; Kang, W.-C., Zhiyuan Cheng, D., Chen, T., Yi, X., Lin, D., Hong, L., Chi, E.H., Learning multi-granular quantized embed-dings for large-vocab categorical features in recommender systems (2020) CoRR, , https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08530, abs/2002.08530 (2020); Kingma, D.P., Ba, J., Adam: A method for stochastic optimization (2015) 3rd International Conference on Learning Representations, Iclr 2015, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980, San Diego, CA, USA, May 7-9, 2015, Conference Track Proceedings; Kumar, P.N.V., Raghunatha Reddy, V., A survey on recommender systems (rss) and its applications (2014) International Journal of Innovative Research in Computer and Communication Engineering, 2 (8), pp. 5254-5260. , 2014; Liu, H., Simonyan, K., Yang, Y., Darts: Diferentiable architecture search (2019) 7th International Conference on Learning Representations, Iclr 2019, , https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1eYHoC5FX, New Orleans, LA, USA, May 6-9, 2019; Luo, R., Tian, F., Qin, T., Chen, E., Liu, T.-Y., Neural architecture optimization (2018) Proceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 7827-7838; Nguyen, H.T.H., Wistuba, M., Grabocka, J., Rêgo Drumond, L., Schmidt-Thieme, L., Personalized deep learning for tag recommendation (2017) Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining-21st Pacifc-Asia Conference, Pakdd 2017, pp. 186-197. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-57454-7-15, Jeju, South Korea, May 23-26, 2017, Proceedings, Part I; Pan, J., Xu, J., Lobos Ruiz, A., Zhao, W., Pan, S., Sun, Y., Lu, Q., Field-weighted factorization machines for click-through rate prediction in display advertising (2018) Proceedings of the 2018 World Wide Web Conference on World Wide Web, Www 2018, pp. 1349-1357. , https://doi.org/10.1145/3178876.3186040, Lyon, France, April 23-27, 2018; Pham, H., Guan, M., Zoph, B., Le, Q., Dean, J., Efcient neural architecture search via parameters sharing (2018) International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 4095-4104; Qu, Y., Fang, B., Zhang, W., Tang, R., Niu, M., Guo, H., Yu, Y., He, X., Product-based neural networks for user response prediction over multi-field categorical data (2019) Acm Trans.

State-of-the-art models usually include explicit feature interactions to better model non-linearity in a deep network, but enumerating all feature combinations of high orders is not efficient and brings challenges to network optimization. In this work, we use AutoML to seek useful high-order feature interactions to train on without manual feature selection. For this purpose, an end-to-end model, AutoGroup, is proposed, which casts the selection of feature interactions as a structural optimization problem. In a nutshell, AutoGroup first automatically groups useful features into a number of feature sets. Then, it generates interactions of any order from these feature sets using a novel interaction function. The main contribution of AutoGroup is that it performs both dimensionality reduction and feature selection which are not seen in previous models. Offline experiments on three public large-scale benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of AutoGroup over state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, a ten-day online A/B test verifies that AutoGroup can be reliably deployed in production and outperform the commercial baseline by 10% on average in terms of CTR and CVR. © 2020 ACM.","automl; deep learning; high-order feature interactions; neural networks; recommender systems","Benchmarking; Dimensionality reduction; Information retrieval; Large dataset; Structural optimization; Benchmark datasets; Click-through rate; End-to-end models; Feature combination; Feature interactions; Interaction functions; Network optimization; Structural optimization problems; Feature extraction","Beutel, A., Covington, P., Jain, S., Xu, C., Li, J., Gatto, V., Chi, E.H., Latent cross: Making use of context in recurrent recommender systems (2018) Proceedings of the Eleventh Acm International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining, pp. 46-54. , ACM; Blondel, M., Fujino, A., Ueda, N., Ishihata, M., Higher-order factorization machines (2016) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 3351-3359; Chang, Y.W., Hsieh, C.J., Chang, K.W., Ringgaard, M., Lin, C.J., Training and testing low-degree polynomial data mappings via linear svm (2010) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 11 (11), pp. 1471-1490. , 2010); Chen, T., Guestrin, C., Xgboost:a scalable tree boosting system (2016) Acm Sigkdd International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 785-794; Cheng, H., Koc, L., Harmsen, J., Shaked, T., Deepak Chandra, T., Aradhye, H., Anderson, G., Ispir, M., Wide & deep learning for recommender systems (2016) Conference on Recommender Systems, pp. 7-10. , 2016); Covington, P., Adams, J., Sargin, E., Deep neural networks for youtube recommendations (2016) Proceedings of the 10th Acm Conference on Recommender Systems, pp. 191-198. , ACM; Elsken, T., Hendrik Metzen, J., Hutter, F., (2018) Neural Architecture Search: A Survey, , arXiv preprint, 2018; Elsken, T., Hendrik Metzen, J., Hutter, F., (2018) Neural Architecture Search: A Survey, , arXiv preprint, 2018; Guo, H., Tang, R., Ye, Y., Li, Z., He, X., (2017) Deepfm: A Factorization-Machine Based Neural Network for Ctr Prediction, , arXiv preprint, 2017; He, X., Chua, T., (2017) Neural Factorization Machines for Sparse Predictive Analytics, pp. 355-364. , 2017); He, X., Pan, J., Jin, O., Xu, T., Liu, B., Xu, T., Shi, Y., Bowers, S., Practical lessons from predicting clicks on ads at facebook (2014) Eighth International Workshop on Data Mining for Online Advertising, pp. 1-9; Hornik, K., Stinchcombe, M., White, H., Multilayer feedforward networks are universal approximators (1989) Neural Networks, 2 (5), pp. 359-366. , 1989); Jang, E., Gu, S., Poole, B., (2016) Categorical Reparameterization with Gumbel-Softmax, , arXiv preprint, 2016; Juan, Y., Zhuang, Y., Chin, W.S., Lin, C.J., Field-Aware factorization machines for ctr prediction (2016) Acm Conference on Recommender Systems, pp. 43-50; Lee, K.C., Orten, B., Dasdan, A., Li, W., Estimating conversion rate in display advertising from past erformance data (2012) Acm Sigkdd International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining, pp. 768-776; Lian, J., Zhou, X., Zhang, F., Chen, Z., Xie, X., Sun, G., (2018) XDeepFM: Combining Explicit and Implicit Feature Interactions for Recommender Systems, , arXiv preprint, 2018; Liaw, A., Wiener, M., Classifcation and regression by ran-domforest (2002) R News, 2 (3), pp. 18-22. , 2002); Liu, B., Tang, R., Chen, Y., Yu, J., Guo, H., Zhang, Y., (2019) Feature Generation by Convolutional Neural Network for Click-Through Rate Prediction, , https://doi.org/10.1145/3308558.3313497, 2019); Liu, C., Zoph, B., Neumann, M., Shlens, J., Hua, W., Li, L.-J., Fei-Fei, L., Murphy, K., Progressive neural architecture search (2018) Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pp. 19-34; Liu, H., Simonyan, K., Yang, Y., (2018) Darts: Diferentiable Architecture Search, , arXiv preprint, 2018; Luo, R., Tian, F., Qin, T., Chen, E., Liu, T.-Y., Neural architecture optimization (2018) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 7816-7827; Maddison, C.J., Tarlow, D., Minka, T., A∗ sampling (2014) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 3086-3094; McMahan, H.B., Holt, G., Sculley, D., Young, M., Ebner, D., Grady, J., Nie, L., Golovin, D., Ad click prediction: A view from the trenches (2013) Proceedings of the 19th Acm Sigkdd International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 1222-1230. , ACM; Pan, J., Xu, J., Lobos Ruiz, A., Zhao, W., Pan, S., Sun, Y., Lu, Q., Field-weighted factorization machines for click-through rate prediction in display advertising (2018) Proceedings of the 2018 World Wide Web Conference.

LUR models leverage information about environmental and anthropogenic factors such as cars, heating, or industry to predict air pollution in areas where no measurements have been made. However, existing approaches are often not globally applicable and require tedious hyper-parameter tuning to enable high quality predictions. In this work, we tackle these issues by introducing OpenLUR, an off-the-shelf approach for modeling air pollution that (i) works on a set of novel features solely extracted from the globally and openly available data source OpenStreetMap and (ii) is based on state-of-the-art machine learning featuring automated hyper-parameter tuning in order to minimize manual effort. We show that our proposed features are able to outperform their counterparts from local and closed sources, and illustrate how automated hyper parameter tuning can yield competitve results while alleviating the need for expert knowledge in machine learning and manual effort. Importantly, we further demonstrate the potential of the global availability of our features by applying cross-learning across different cities in order to reduce the need for a large amount of training samples. Overall, OpenLUR represents an off-the-shelf approach that facilitates easily reproducible experiments and the development of globally applicable models. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Automated machine learning; Land use regression; LUR; OpenStreetMap; Pollution","Air pollution; Land use; Air Pollution Modeling; Anthropogenic factors; Closed source; Expert knowledge; Hyper-parameter; Land use regression; Particulate Matter; Training sample; Machine learning; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; machine learning; numerical model; particulate matter; regression analysis; software; air pollution; article; city; land use; machine learning","Aguilera, I., Sunyer, J., Fernández-Patier, R., Hoek, G., Aguirre-Alfaro, A., Meliefste, K., Bomboi-Mingarro, M.T., Brunekreef, B., Estimation of outdoor no x, no2, and btex exposure in a cohort of pregnant women using land use regression modeling (2007) Environ.

Numerous analysis pipelines have been developed to improve the reliability and scalability of pre-processing and ROI extraction for these large calcium imaging datasets. Despite these advancements in pre-processing methods, manual curation of the extracted spatial footprints and calcium traces of neurons remains important for quality control. Here, we propose an additional semi-automated curation step for sorting spatial footprints and calcium traces from putative neurons extracted using the popular constrained non-negative matrixfactorization for microendoscopic data (CNMF-E) algorithm. We used the automated machine learning (AutoML) tools TPOT and AutoSklearn to generate classifiers to curate the extracted ROIs trained on a subset of human-labeled data. AutoSklearn produced the best performing classifier, achieving an F1 score >92% on the ground truth test dataset. This automated approach is a useful strategy for filtering ROIs with relatively few labeled data points and can be easily added to pre-existing pipelines currently using CNMF-E for ROI extraction. © Copyright © 2020 Tran, Mocle, Ramsaran, Jacob, Frankland and Josselyn.","1-photon; calcium imaging; CNMF-E; machine learning; microendoscopy; open-source","calcium; algorithm; animal cell; Article; automation; calcium cell level; classifier; machine learning; measurement accuracy; mouse; non-negative matrix factorization; nonhuman; prediction; scoring system; validation process","Badura, A., Sun, X.R., Giovannucci, A., Lynch, L.A., Wang, S.S.H., Fast calcium sensor proteins for monitoring neural activity (2014) Neurophotonics, 1, p. 025008. , 25558464; Cai, D.J., Aharoni, D., Shuman, T., Shobe, J., Biane, J., Song, W., A shared neural ensemble links distinct contextual memories encoded close in time (2016) Nature, 534, pp. 115-118. , 27251287; Cohen, J., (2013) Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences, , New York, NY, Routledge; Feurer, M., Klein, A., Eggensperger, K., Springenberg, J.T., Blum, M., Hutter, F., Auto-sklearn: efficient and robust automated machine (2015) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 2962-2970. , Montreal, CA, NIPS 2015, “,” (, :,), 28; Ghosh, K.K., Burns, L.D., Cocker, E.D., Nimmerjahn, A., Ziv, Y., Gamal, A.E., Miniaturized integration of a fluorescence microscope (2011) Nat.

In this exploratory proof-of-concept work, 8 key features (building, door, fence, streetlight, tree, window, hedge, and garage) are considered and a worked case-study is demonstrated for a small geographical area (8300 square kilometres) in Northern England. A total of 60,100 images were automatically collected and analysed across the area where 5288 crime incidents were reported over a twelve-month period. Dependency between features and crime incidents are measured; however, no strong correlation has been identified. This is unsurprisingly considering the high number of crime incidents in a small geographic region (8300 square kilometres), resulting in an overlap between specific features and multiple crime incidents. Furthermore, due to the unknown precise location of crime instances, an approximation technique is developed to survey a crime's local proximity. Despite the absence of a strong correlation, this paper presents a first-of-a-kind cross-discipline approach to attempt and use computation techniques to produce new empirical knowledge. There are many avenues of future research in this fertile and important area. © 2020 The Author(s).","Crime analytics; Crime prevention; Feature recognition; Supervised machine learning",,"Armitage, R., (2013) Crime Prevention through Housing Design: Policy and Practice, , Springer Berlin; Armitage, R., Monchuk, L., Sustaining the crime reduction impact of designing out crime: Re-evaluating the secured by design scheme 10 years on (2011) Security Journal, 24 (4), pp. 320-343; Armitage, R., Monchuk, L., What is CPTED?

Despite this progress to date, the application of time series analysis has remained underexplored due to complexity of the underlying techniques. In this study, we have deployed a novel ML, called automated time series (AutoTS) machine learning, to automate data processing and the application of a multitude of models to assess which best forecasts future values. This rapid experimentation allows for and enables the selection of the most accurate model in order to perform time series predictions. By using the nation-wide ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision) dataset of hospitalized patients of Romania, we have generated time series datasets over the period of 2008–2018 and performed highly accurate AutoTS predictions for the ten deadliest diseases. Forecast results for the years 2019 and 2020 were generated on a NUTS 2 (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) regional level. This is the first study to our knowledge to perform time series forecasting of multiple diseases at a regional level using automated time series machine learning on a national ICD-10 dataset. The deployment of AutoTS technology can help decision makers in implementing targeted national health policies more efficiently. © 2020 by the authors.","Artificial intelligence; Automated machine learning; Deadliest diseases; Deep learning; Disease prediction; Time series","automation; data processing; database; forecasting method; health policy; machine learning; model; time series analysis; Alzheimer disease; Article; automation; cerebrovascular accident; chronic obstructive lung disease; cost; diabetes mellitus; diarrhea; forecasting; hospital patient; human; ICD-10; ischemic heart disease; lower respiratory tract infection; lung cancer; machine learning; prediction; public health; Romania; time series analysis; traffic accident; tuberculosis; Romania","Chen, P.C., Liu, Y., Peng, L., How to develop machine learning models for healthcare (2019) Nat.

However, qualitative radiologic MR imaging review has limited performance. This study aimed to compare different machine learning approaches to classify pediatric posterior fossa tumors on routine MR imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included preoperative MR imaging of 288 patients with pediatric posterior fossa tumors, including medulloblastoma (n=111), ependymoma (n=70), and pilocytic astrocytoma (n=107). Radiomics features were extracted from T2-weighted images, contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images, and ADC maps. Models generated by standard manual optimization by a machine learning expert were compared with automatic machine learning via the Tree-Based Pipeline Optimization Tool for performance evaluation. RESULTS: For 3-way classification, the radiomics model by automatic machine learning with the Tree-Based Pipeline Optimization Tool achieved a test micro-averaged area under the curve of 0.91 with an accuracy of 0.83, while the most optimized model based on the feature-selection method χ2score and the Generalized Linear Model classifier achieved a test micro-averaged area under the curve of 0.92 with an accuracy of 0.74. Tree-Based Pipeline Optimization Tool models achieved significantly higher accuracy than average qualitative expert MR imaging review (0.83 versus 0.54, P&lt;.001). For binary classification, Tree-Based Pipeline Optimization Tool models achieved an area under the curve of 0.94 with an accuracy of 0.85 for medulloblastoma versus nonmedulloblastoma, an area under the curve of 0.84 with an accuracy of 0.80 for ependymoma versus nonependymoma, and an area under the curve of 0.94 with an accuracy of 0.88 for pilocytic astrocytoma versus non-pilocytic astrocytoma. CONCLUSIONS: Automatic machine learning based on routine MR imaging classified pediatric posterior fossa tumors with high accuracy compared with manual expert pipeline optimization and qualitative expert MR imaging review. © The Author(s), 2020.",,"adolescent; adult; area under the curve; Article; automation; binary classification; child; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; ependymoma; feature selection; female; human; image segmentation; infant; machine learning; major clinical study; male; medulloblastoma; multiclass classification; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pilocytic astrocytoma; posterior cranial fossa tumor; radiomics; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; support vector machine; tumor differentiation","Curtin, SC, Miniño, AM, Anderson, RN., National Center for Health Statistics.

This study investigates to what extent a new machine learning (ML) pipeline may preferentially identify links between similar scientific articles. The characteristics of intersections and unions of keywords, contextualized keywords (i.e., synsets) and neighbors are computed and used to train a ML model. Automated machine learning (AutoML) is then applied to ease the search for a new pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrated that a newly designed ML model achieves an accuracy of 90% on a dataset of approximately 120,000 article pairs. These results suggest that application of ML for proposing new recommendation systems could have in the long term a positive impact in the literature. © 2020 IEEE.","AutoML; evolutionary algorithms; information retrieval; semantic similarity; Word sense disambiguation","Pipelines; Recommender systems; Automated machines; Journal articles; New approaches; Scientific articles; Synsets; Machine learning","Hey, T., Trefethen, A., The data deluge: An e-science perspective (2003) Communications Networking & Distributed Systems, pp. 809-824. , Wiley; Bai, X., Wang, M., Lee, I., Yang, Z., Kong, X., Xia, F., Scientific paper recommendation: A survey (2019) IEEE Access, 7, pp. 9324-9339; Sharma, R., Gopalani, D., Meena, Y., Concept-based approach for research paper recommendation (2017) PReMI, pp. 687-692. , Springer; Reyhani Hamedani, M., Kim, S.-W., Kim, D.-J., Simcc: A novel method to consider both content and citations for computing similarity of scientific papers (2016) Information Sciences, 334-335, pp. 273-292; Matsatsinis, N.F., Lakiotaki, K., Delias, P., A system based on multiple criteria analysis for scientific paper recommendation (2007) PCI, pp. 135-149; McNee, S.M., Albert, I., Cosley, D., Gopalkrishnan, P., Lam, S.K., Rashid, A.M., Konstan, J.A., Riedl, J., On the recommending of citations for research papers (2002) CSCW.

DNNs have been used to improve several speech processing algorithms that improve speech perception for hearing impaired listeners. To make use of DNNs to their full potential and to configure models easily, automated machine learning (AutoML) systems are developed, focusing on model optimization. As an application of AutoML to audio and hearing aids, this work presents an AutoML based voice activity detector (VAD) that is implemented on a smartphone as a real-time application. The developed VAD can be used to elevate the performance of speech processing applications like speech enhancement that are widely used in hearing aid devices. The classification model generated by AutoML is computationally fast and has minimal processing delay, which enables an efficient, real-time operation on a smartphone. The steps involved in real-time implementation are discussed in detail. The key contribution of this work include the utilization of AutoML platform for hearing aid applications and the realization of AutoML model on smartphone. The experimental analysis and results demonstrate the significance and importance of using the AutoML for the current approach. The evaluations also show improvements over the state of art techniques and reflect the practical usability of the developed smartphone app in different noisy environments. © 2020 IEEE.","Automated Machine Learning; AutoML; Hearing aid devices (HADs); real-time; smartphone; Voice Activity Detection (VAD)","Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Hearing aids; Learning systems; mHealth; Real time control; Smartphones; Speech enhancement; Classification models; Experimental analysis; Hearing-impaired listeners; Processing algorithms; Processing applications; Real-time implementations; Speech classification; Voice activity detectors; Audition","Matt, G., (2018) Allennlp: A Deep Semantic Natural Language Processing Platform, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1803.07640; David, S., X-vectors: Robust dnn embeddings for speaker recognition (2018) 2018 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP).

Methods: The study presents an experimental machine learning (ML) model based on Google Cloud AutoML Vision instead of a handcrafted neural network. A public dataset of 278,124 labeled histopathology images is used as the original dataset for the model creation. In order to balance the number of positive and negative IDC samples, this study also augments the original public dataset by rotating a large portion of positive image samples. As a result, a total number of 378,215 labeled images are applied. Results: A score of 91.6% average accuracy is achieved during the model evaluation as measured by the area under precision-recall curve (AuPRC). A subsequent test on a held-out test dataset (unseen by the model) yields a balanced accuracy of 84.6%. These results outperform the ones reported in the earlier studies. Similar performance is observed from a generalization test with new breast tissue samples we collected from the hospital. Conclusions: The results obtained from this study demonstrate the maturity and feasibility of an AutoML approach for IDC identification. The study also shows the advantage of AutoML approach when combined at scale with cloud computing. © 2020","AutoML vision; Breast cancer; Digital pathology; Google cloud; Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC); Machine learning; Whole slide image (WSI)","Large dataset; Machine learning; Web services; Breast tissues; Invasive ductal carcinomata; Labeled images; Machine learning models; Model creation; Model evaluation; Model-based OPC; Whole slide images; Statistical tests; Article; automation; breast carcinoma; cloud computing; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; experimental model; histopathology; human; human tissue; machine learning; priority journal; program feasibility","Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) (2020), https://www.nationalbreastcancer.org/invasive-ductal-carcinoma; (2020) Breastcancer.org, “Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC)”, , https://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/types/idc; Frierson, H.F., Interobserver reproducibility of the Nottingham modification of the Bloom and Richardson histologic grading scheme for infiltrating ductal carcinoma (1995) Am.

These two competitions aim at searching for fully automated solutions for classification tasks in computer vision, with an emphasis on any-time performance. The first competition was limited to image classification while the second one included both images and videos. Our design imposed to the participants to submit their code on a challenge platform for blind testing on five datasets, both for training and testing, without any human intervention whatsoever. Winning solutions adopted deep learning techniques based on already published architectures, such as AutoAugment, MobileNet and ResNet, to reach state-of-the-art performance in the time budget of the challenge (only 20 minutes of GPU time). The novel contributions include strategies to deliver good preliminary results at any time during the learning process, such that a method can be stopped early and still deliver good performance. This feature is key for the adoption of such techniques by data analysts desiring to obtain rapidly preliminary results on large datasets and to speed up the development process. The soundness of our design was verified in several aspects: (1) Little overfitting of the on-line leaderboard providing feedback on 5 development datasets was observed, compared to the final blind testing on the 5 (separate) final test datasets, suggesting that winning solutions might generalize to other computer vision classification tasks; (2) Error bars on the winners’ performance allow us to say with confident that they performed significantly better than the baseline solutions we provided; (3) The ranking of participants according to the any-time metric we designed, namely the Area under the Learning Curve, was different from that of the fixed-time metric, i.e. AUC at the end of the fixed time budget. We released all winning solutions under open-source licenses. At the end of the AutoDL challenge series, all data of the challenge will be made publicly available, thus providing a collection of uniformly formatted datasets, which can serve to conduct further research, particularly on meta-learning. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","AutoML; Computer vision; Deep learning","Automation; Budget control; Classification (of information); Deep learning; Large dataset; Learning systems; Classification tasks; Development process; Human intervention; Learning process; Learning techniques; Open source license; State-of-the-art performance; Training and testing; Computer vision","Cubuk, E.D., Zoph, B., Mane, D., Vasudevan, V., Le, Q.V., Autoaugment: learning augmentation policies from data (2018); He, K., Zhang, X., Ren, S., Sun, J., Deep residual learning for image recognition (2016) CVPR, pp. 770-778. , IEEE; Howard, A.G., Zhu, M., Chen, B., Kalenichenko, D., Wang, W., Weyand, T., Andreetto, M., Adam, H., Mobilenets: efficient convolutional neural networks for mobile vision applications (2017); Kingma, D.P., Ba, J., (2014), Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization; Lim, S., Kim, I., Kim, T., Kim, C., Kim, S., (2019), Fast autoaugment; Liu, Z., Guyon, I., Jacques, J., Jr., Madadi, M., Escalera, S., Pavao, A., Escalante, H.J., Treguer, S., AutoCV challenge design and baseline results (2019) CAp 2019, Toulouse, France, , https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02265053, URL:; Pham, H., Guan, M.Y., Zoph, B., Le, Q.V., Dean, J., (2018), Efficient Neural Architecture Search via Parameter Sharing; Szegedy, C., Vanhoucke, V., Ioffe, S., Shlens, J., Wojna, Z., Rethinking the inception architecture for computer vision (2016) CVPR, pp. 2818-2826. , IEEE Las Vegas, NV, USA; Tan, M., Le, Q., Efficientnet: rethinking model scaling for convolutional neural networks (2019) ICML, pp. 6105-6114; Zoph, B., Le, Q.V., (2016), Neural architecture search with reinforcement learning","Pattern Recogn.

However, one criticism of this is that there are still hyperparameters which must be tuned in order to achieve good performance. In this work, we propose a near parameter-free genetic programming approach, which adapts the hyperparameter values throughout evolution without ever needing to be specified manually. We apply this to the area of automated machine learning (by extending TPOT), to produce pipelines which can effectively be claimed to be free from human input, and show that the results are competitive with existing state-of-the-art which use hand-selected hyperparameter values. Pipelines begin with a randomly chosen estimator and evolve to competitive pipelines automatically.

However, designing of such models with high accuracy and low computation requirements is a difficult task and needs extensive human expertise. Recent advances in Neural Architecture Search use various methods like Deep Reinforcement Learning, Evolutionary methods, Gradient Descent, HyperNetworks etc. to automatically generate neural networks with high level of accuracy. However, large size of such generated models limit their practical use. Recent findings about lottery ticket hypothesis suggest the existence of sparse subnetworks (winning tickets) which can reach the accuracy comparable to that of original dense network. In this paper, we present a method for leveraging redundancies inherent to deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to guide the generation of sparse CNN models (to find the architectures with winning tickets) without significant loss in accuracy. We evaluate our proposed method with different NAS methods on CFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and MNIST datasets. Our results show a reduction ranging from 2\times \mathrm{to} 12\times in terms of model size and 2\times \mathrm{to}19\times in terms of number of MAC operations with less than 1% drop in accuracy. © 2020 IEEE.","AutoML; Computer Vision; Neural Architecture Search; Sparse","Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Gradient methods; Network architecture; Reinforcement learning; Dense network; Evolutionary method; Gradient descent; High-accuracy; Human expertise; Neural architectures; Practical use; Subnetworks; Convolutional neural networks","Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., Hinton, G.E., Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks (2012) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 25, pp. 1097-1105. , F.

Multiple scales, dual priorities, speed, limited data, and class imbalance make object detection a very challenging task. In underwater object detection, further complications come in to play due to acoustic image problems such as non-homogeneous resolution, non-uniform intensity, speckle noise, acoustic shadowing, acoustic reverberation, and multipath problems. Therefore, we focus on finding solutions to the problems along the underwater object detection pipeline. A pipeline for realizing a robust generic object detector will be described and demonstrated on a case study of detection of an underwater docking station in sonar images. The system shows an overall detection and classification performance average precision (AP) score of 0.98392 for a test set of 5000 underwater sonar frames. © 2020 by the authors.

Although its outstanding potential, development of efficient architectures and modules requires expert knowledge and amount of resource time available. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary-based neural architecture search approach for efficient discovery of convolutional models in a dynamic search space, within only 24 GPU hours. With its efficient search environment and phenotype representation, Gene Expression Programming is adapted for network's cell generation. Despite having limited GPU resource time and broad search space, our proposal achieved similar state-of-the-art to manually-designed convolutional networks and also NAS-generated ones, even beating similar constrained evolutionary-based NAS works. The best cells in different runs achieved stable results, with a mean error of 2.82 % in CIFAR-10 dataset (which the best model achieved an error of 2.67 %) and 18.83 % for CIFAR-100 (best model with 18.16 %). For ImageNet in the mobile setting, our best model achieved top-l and top-5 errors of 29.51 % and 10.37 %, respectively. Although evolutionary-based NAS works were reported to require a considerable amount of GPU time for architecture search, our approach obtained promising results in little time, encouraging further experiments in evolutionary-based NAS, for search and network representation improvements. © 2020 IEEE.","automl; cnn; deep learning; gene expression programming; neural architecture search","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Errors; Gene expression; Graphics processing unit; Image enhancement; Image segmentation; Learning systems; Memory architecture; Computational resources; Convolutional model; Convolutional networks; Efficient architecture; Gene expression programming; Network representation; Neural architectures; Regions of interest; Network architecture","Elsken, T., Metzen, J.H., Hutter, F., (2018) Neural Architecture Search: A Survey; Elsken, T., Metzen, J.-H., Hutter, F., (2017) Simple and Efficient Architecture Search for Convolutional Neural Networks; Elsken, T., Metzen, J.H., Hutter, F., (1804) Efficient Multi-objective Neural Architecture Search Via Lamarckian Evolution; Szegedy, C., Ioffe, S., Vanhoucke, V., Alemi, A.A., Inception-v4, inception-resnet and the impact of residual connections on learning (2017) AAAI, 4, p. 12; Liu, H., Simonyan, K., Yang, Y., (2018) Darts: Differentiable Architecture Search; Zoph, B., Vasudevan, V., Shlens, J., Le, Q.V., (2017) Learning Transferable Architectures for Scalable Image Recognition, 2 (6); Real, E., Aggarwal, A., Huang, Y., Le, Q.V., (2018) Regularized Evolution for Image Classifier Architecture Search; Baker, B., Gupta, O., Naik, N., Raskar, R., (2016) Designing Neural Network Architectures Using Reinforcement Learning; Liu, H., Simonyan, K., Vinyals, O., Fernando, C., Kavukcuoglu, K., (2017) Hierarchical Representations for Efficient Architecture Search; Real, E., Moore, S., Selle, A., Saxena, S., Suematsu, Y.L., Tan, J., Le, Q.V., Kurakin, A., Large-scale evolution of image classifiers (2017) International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 2902-2911; Miikkulainen, R., Liang, J., Meyerson, E., Rawal, A., Fink, D., Francon, O., Raju, B., Duffy, N., (2017) Evolving Deep Neural Networks; Suganuma, M., Shirakawa, S., Nagao, T., A genetic programming approach to designing convolutional neural network architectures (2017) Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference.

With the progression of AutoML, several effective methods were introduced, especially for traditional classification and regression problems. Apart from the AutoML success, several issues remain open. One issue, in particular, is the lack of ability of AutoML methods to deal with different types of data. Based on this scenario, this paper approaches AutoML for multi-label classification (MLC) problems. In MLC, each example can be simultaneously associated to several class labels, unlike the standard classification task, where an example is associated to just one class label. In this work, we provide a general comparison of five automated multi-label classification methods - two evolutionary methods, one Bayesian optimization method, one random search and one greedy search - on 14 datasets and three designed search spaces. Overall, we observe that the most prominent method is the one based on a canonical grammar-based genetic programming (GGP) search method, namely Auto-MEKAGGP. Auto-MEKAGGP presented the best average results in our comparison and was statistically better than all the other methods in different search spaces and evaluated measures, except when compared to the greedy search method. © 2020 ACM.","Automated machine learning (AutoML); Multi-label classification; Search methods; Search spaces","Automation; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Machine learning; Automated machines; Bayesian optimization; Classification tasks; Evolutionary method; Experimental evaluation; Grammar-based genetic programming; Greedy search methods; Multi label classification; Classification (of information)","Back, T., Fogel, D.B., Michalewicz, Z., (1999) Evolutionary Computation 2: Advanced Algorithms and Operators, , (1st ed.)

Automated machine learning aims to free (or at least ease) the developer from the burden of pipeline creation, but this overfitting problem can persist. In fact, this can become more of a problem as we look to iteratively optimise the performance of an internal cross-validation (most often k-fold). While this internal cross-validation hopes to reduce this overfitting, we show we can still risk overfitting to the particular folds used. In this work, we aim to remedy this problem by introducing dynamic fitness evaluations which approximate repeated k-fold cross-validation, at little extra cost over single k-fold, and far lower cost than typical repeated k-fold. The results show that when time equated, the proposed fitness function results in significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art baseline method which uses an internal single k-fold. Furthermore, the proposed extension is very simple to implement on top of existing evolutionary computation methods, and can provide essentially a free boost in generalisation/testing performance. © 2020 ACM.","Automated machine learning; AutoML; Dynamic fitness evaluations; Generalisation; Regularization; Regularized evolution","Calculations; Health; Iterative methods; Machine learning; Automated machines; Baseline methods; Cross validation; Fitness evaluations; Fitness functions; K fold cross validations; Over fitting problem; State of the art; Pipelines","Bengio, Y., Grandvalet, Y., No unbiased estimator of the variance of k-fold cross-validation (2004) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 5, pp. 1089-1105. , 2004, Sep; Bouckaert, R.R., Frank, E., Evaluating the replicability of significance tests for comparing learning algorithms (2004) Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 3-12. , Springer; Demšar, J., Statistical comparisons of classifiers over multiple data sets (2006) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 7, pp. 1-30. , 2006, Jan; Dietterich, T.G., Approximate statistical tests for comparing supervised classification learning algorithms (1998) Neural Computation, 10 (7), pp. 1895-1923. , 1998; Evans, B., (2019) Population-based Ensemble Learning with Tree Structures for Classification, , 2019; Feurer, M., Klein, A., Eggensperger, K., Springenberg, J., Blum, M., Hutter, F., Efficient and robust automated machine learning (2015) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 28, pp. 2962-2970. , http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5872-efficient-and-robust-automatedmachine-learning.pdf, C.

However, clinical interpretation of the increasingly large sets of data these technologies generate remains a challenge. Machine learning is a popular approach to discover and detect signatures of disease. However, limited machine learning expertise in the LB field has kept the discipline from fully leveraging these tools and risks improper analyses and irreproducible results. In this paper, we develop a web-based automated machine learning tool tailored specifically for LB, where machine learning models can be built without the user's input. We also incorporate a differential privacy algorithm, designed to limit the effects of overfitting that can arise from users iteratively developing a panel with feedback from our platform. We validate our approach by performing a meta-analysis on 11 published LB datasets, and found that we had similar or better performance compared to those reported in the literature. Moreover, we show that our platform's performance improved when incorporating information from prior LB datasets, suggesting that this approach can continue to improve with increased access to LB data. Finally, we show that by using our platform the results achieved in the literature can be matched using 40% of the number of subjects in the training set, potentially reducing study cost and time. This self-improving and overfitting-resistant automatic machine learning platform provides a new standard that can be used to validate machine learning works in the LB field.

Molecular modeling and simulations are invaluable tools, extensively used over the last two decades for the study of various properties of MOFs. In particular, Monte Carlo simulation techniques have been employed for the study of the gas uptake capacity of several MOFs at a wide range of different thermodynamic conditions. Despite the accurate predictions of molecular simulations, the accurate characterization and the high-throughput screening of the enormous number of MOFs that can be potentially synthesized by combining various structural building blocks is beyond present computer capabilities. In this work, we propose and demonstrate the use of an alternative approach, namely one based on an Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) architecture that is capable of training machine learning and statistical predictive models for MOFs’ chemical properties and estimate their predictive performance with confidence intervals. The architecture tries numerous combinations of different machine learning (ML) algorithms, tunes their hyper-parameters, and conservatively estimates performance of the final model. We demonstrate that it correctly estimates performance even with few samples (<100) and that it provides improved predictions over trying a single standard method, like Random Forests. The AutoML pipeline democratizes ML to non-expert material-science practitioners that may not know which algorithms to use on a given problem, how to tune them, and how to correctly estimate their predictive performance, dramatically improving productivity and avoiding common analysis pitfalls.

Given a tabular dataset and the target column name, Autopilot identifies the problem type, analyzes the data and produces a diverse set of complete ML pipelines, which are tuned to generate a leaderboard of candidate models that the customer can choose from. The diversity allows users to balance between different needs such as model accuracy vs. latency. By exposing not only the final models but the way they are trained, meaning the pipelines, we allow to customize the generated training pipeline, thus catering the need of users with different levels of expertise. This trait is crucial for users and is the main novelty of Autopilot; it provides a solution that on one hand is not fully black-box and can be further worked on, while on the other hand is not a do it yourself solution, requiring expertise in all aspects of machine learning. This paper describes the different components in the eco-system of Autopilot, emphasizing the infrastructure choices that allow scalability, high quality models, editable ML pipelines, consumption of artifacts of offline meta-learning, and a convenient integration with the entire SageMaker system allowing these trained models to be used in a production setting. © 2020 Owner/Author.",,"Air navigation; Information management; Machine learning; Automatic machines; Black boxes; Candidate models; Do it yourself; High quality; Metalearning; Model accuracy; White box; Pipelines","(2019) Sagemaker-scikit-learn-extension, , http://github.com/aws/sagemakerscikit-learn-extension/; (2020), http://kaggle.com, Kaggle.com; Buitinck, L., Louppe, G., Blondel, M., Pedregosa, F., Mueller, A., Grisel, O., Niculae, V., Gaël, Varoquaux., API design for machine learning software: Experiences from the scikit-learn project (2013) ECML PKDD Workshop: Languages for Data Mining and Machine Learning, pp. 108-122; Automated Machine Learning, , http://www.datarobot.com/platform/automated-machine-learning/, DataRobot; Dua, D., Graff, C., (2017) UCI Machine Learning Repository, , http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml; Erickson, N., Mueller, J., Shirkov, A., Zhang, H., Larroy, P., Li, M., Smola, A., (2020) AutoGluon-Tabular: Robust and Accurate AutoML for Structured Data, , arXiv preprint, 2020; Falkner, S., Klein, A., Hutter, F., (2018) BOHB: Robust and Efficient Hyperparameter Optimization at Scale, , arXiv preprint, 2018; Feurer, M., Klein, A., Eggensperger, K., Springenberg, J., Blum, M., Hutter, F., Efficient and robust automated machine learning (2015) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28, pp. 2962-2970. , http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5872-efficient-and-robust-automatedmachine-learning.pdf, C.

The proliferation of libraries and frameworks and the complexity of the tasks have led to the emergence of ""pipeline jungles"" - brittle, ad hoc ML systems. To address these problems, we introduce the Machine Learning Bazaar, a new framework for developing machine learning and automated machine learning software systems. First, we introduce ML primitives, a unified API and specification for data processing and ML components from different software libraries. Next, we compose primitives into usable ML pipelines, abstracting away glue code, data flow, and data storage. We further pair these pipelines with a hierarchy of AutoML strategies - Bayesian optimization and bandit learning. We use these components to create a general-purpose, multi-task, end-to-end AutoML system that provides solutions to a variety of data modalities (image, text, graph, tabular, relational, etc.) and problem types (classification, regression, anomaly detection, graph matching, etc.). We demonstrate 5 real-world use cases and 2 case studies of our approach. Finally, we present an evaluation suite of 456 real-world ML tasks and describe the characteristics of 2.5 million pipelines searched over this task suite. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.","AutoML; machine learning; ML pipelines; ML primitives; software development","Anomaly detection; Data handling; Digital storage; Pipelines; Text processing; Automated machines; Bayesian optimization; Case-studies; Data storage; Effective systems; Graph matchings; Software libraries; Specific tasks; Machine learning","Abadi, M., Agarwal, A., Barham, P., Brevdo, E., Chen, Z., Citro, C., Corrado, G.S., Zheng, X., (2015) TensorFlow: Large-Scale Machine Learning on Heterogeneous Systems, , https://www.tensorflow.org/, Software available from tensorflow. org; Auer, P., Cesa-Bianchi, N., Fischer, P., Finite-time analysis of the multiarmed bandit problem (2002) Machine Learning, 47 (2-3), pp. 235-256. , (2002); Baylor, D., Breck, E., Cheng, H., Fiedel, N., Yu Foo, C., Haque, Z., Haykal, S., Zinkevich, M., Tfx: A tensorflow-based production-scale machine learning platform (2017) KDD; Bergstra, J., Bengio, Y., Random search for hyper-parameter optimization (2012) JMLR, 13, pp. 281-305. , (2012); Bergstra, J.S., Bardenet, R., Bengio, Y., Kégl, B., Algorithms for hyper-parameter optimization (2011) NIPS, pp. 2546-2554; Bhardwaj, A., Bhattacherjee, S., Chavan, A., Deshpande, A., Elmore, A.J., Madden, S., Parameswaran, A., Datahub: Collaborative data science & dataset version management at scale (2015) CIDR; Bird, S., Klein, E., Loper, E., (2009) Natural Language Processing with Python: Analyzing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit, , O'Reilly Media, Inc; Bischl, B., Casalicchio, G., Feurer, M., Hutter, F., Lang, M., Mantovani, R.G., Rijn Van, J.N., Vanschoren, J., (2017) OpenML Benchmarking Suites and the OpenML100, , (2017); Boehm, M., Dusenberry, M.W., Eriksson, D., Evfimievski, A.V., Makari Manshadi, F., Pansare, N., Reinwald, B., Tatikonda, S., Systemml: Declarative machine learning on spark (2016) PVLDB, 9 (13), pp. 1425-1436. , 2016; Bradski, G., The opencv library (2000) Dr. Dobb's Journal of Software Tools, , (2000); Buitinck, L., Louppe, G., Blondel, M., Pedregosa, F., Mueller, A., Grisel, O., Niculae, V., Varoquaux, G., Api design for machine learning software: Experiences from the scikit-learn project (2013) ECML PKDD Workshop: Languages for Data Mining and Machine Learning, pp. 108-122; Crankshaw, D., Bailis, P., Gonzalez, J.E., Li, H., Zhang, Z., Franklin, M.J., Ghodsi, A., Jordan, M.I., The missing piece in complex analytics: Low latency, scalable model management and serving with velox (2015) CIDR; Crotty, A., Galakatos, A., Zgraggen, E., Binnig, C., Kraska, T., Vizdom: Interactive analytics through pen and touch (2015) Proc.

The choice of network architecture has proven critical, and many improvements in deep learning are due to new structuring of it. However, deep learning techniques are computationally intensive and their use requires a high level of domain knowledge. Even a partial automation of this process therefore helps to make deep learning more accessible for everyone. In this tutorial we present a uniform formalism that enables different methods to be categorized and compare the different approaches in terms of their performance. We achieve this through a comprehensive discussion of the commonly used architecture search spaces and architecture optimization algorithms based on reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms as well as approaches that include surrogate and one-shot models. In addition, we discuss approaches to accelerate the search for neural architectures based on early termination and transfer learning and address the new research directions, which include constrained and multi-objective architecture search as well as the automated search for data augmentation, optimizers, and activation functions. © 2020 Owner/Author.","AutoML; Deep learning; Neural architecture search","Automation; Constrained optimization; Evolutionary algorithms; Learning systems; Network architecture; Reinforcement learning; Transfer learning; Activation functions; Architecture optimization; Automated searches; Data augmentation; Early termination; Learning techniques; Neural architectures; Partial automation; Deep learning","Baker, B., Gupta, O., Naik, N., Raskar, R., Designing neural network architectures using reinforcement learning (2017) 5th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2017, , https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1c2cvqee, Toulon, France, April 24-26, 2017, Conference Track Proceedings; Baker, B., Gupta, O., Raskar, R., Naik, N., Accelerating neural architecture search using performance prediction (2018) 6th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2018, , https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJqk3N1vG, Vancouver, BC, Canada, April 30-May 3, 2018, Workshop Track Proceedings; Bello, I., Zoph, B., Vasudevan, V., Le, Q.V., Neural optimizer search with reinforcement learning (2017) Proceedings of the 34th International Conference on Machine Learning, ICML 2017, pp. 459-468. , http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/bello17a.html, Sydney, NSW, Australia 6-11 August 2017; Cai, H., Chen, T., Zhang, W., Yu, Y., Wang, J., Efficient architecture search by network transformation (2018) Proceedings of the Thirty-Second AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, (AAAI-18), the 30th Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence (IAAI-18), and the 8th AAAI Symposium on Educational Advances in Artificial Intelligence (EAAI-18), pp. 2787-2794. , https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/16755, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA, February 2-7, 2018; Dogus Cubuk, E., Zoph, B., Mané, D., Vasudevan, V., Le, Q.V., (2018) AutoAugment: Learning Augmentation Policies from Data, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09501, CoRR abs/1805. 09501 2018; Domhan, T., Tobias Springenberg, J., Hutter, F., Speeding up automatic hyperparameter optimization of deep neural networks by extrapolation of learning curves (2015) Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, IJCAI 2015, pp. 3460-3468. , http://ijcai.org/Abstract/15/487, Buenos Aires, Argentina, July 25-31, 2015; Dong, J., Cheng, A., Juan, D., Wei, W., Sun, M., Dpp-net: Device-aware progressive search for pareto-optimal neural architectures (2018) Computer Vision-ECCV 2018-15th European Conference, pp. 540-555. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-01252-6_32, Munich, Germany, September 8-14, 2018, Proceedings, Part XI (Lecture Notes in Computer Science), Vittorio Ferrari, Martial Hebert, Cristian Sminchisescu, and Yair Weiss (Eds.) 11215.

These applications are developed by third-party developers and depend on a continuous information flow but do not operate the sensor network themselves. However, in case of sensor failures, the flow of information will be interrupted which will pose a problem for the user/application as well as the data provider who might not be able to replace the sensor in time. Depending on the requirements of the application, estimators which are trained through machine learning algorithms, called Virtual Sensors, can ensure the uninterrupted operation of the application. However, for a solution that can be used in practice, the deployment of such a Virtual Sensor needs to be fast enough as well as fully automated, so that no human interaction and domain knowledge is required. This paper describes a framework that is capable of finding correlating IoT sensors in the surrounding environment, selecting a machine learning algorithm, and training a fitting model to run a Virtual Sensor. © 2020 IEEE.","AutoML; faulty sensors; IoT; machine learning; model search; virtual sensing","E-learning; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Sensor networks; Automated machines; Domain knowledge; Fully automated; Human interactions; Information flows; Internet of thing (IOT); Surrounding environment; Uninterrupted operations; Internet of things","8 in 2018: The Top Transformative Technologies to Watch This Year, , https://cdn.ihs.com/www/pdf/IHS-Markit-2018-Top-Transformative-Technology-Trends.pdf; Niles, I., Pease, A., Toward a standard upper ontology (2001) Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Formal Ontology in Information Systems (FOIS-2001), pp. 2-9. , Chris Welty and Barry Smith, eds; Fujiwara, K., Kano, M., Hasebe, S., Takinami, A., Softsensor development using correlation based just In Time modeling (2009) AIChE Journal, 55 (7), pp. 1754-1765; Karol, F., Gabriel, L., Tomas, S., Peter, K., The network architecture designed for an adaptable iotbased smart office solution (2013) International Journal of Computer Networks and Communications Security, 1, pp. 216-224; (2014) C'T Developer: Heimautomatisierung mit OpenHAB: Neue Bindings und Ausblick in Die Zukunft Vom 25, , https://www.heise.de/developer/meldung/Heimautomatisierung-mitopenHAB-neue-Bindings-und-Ausblick-in-die-Zukunft-2462924.html, November; Kabadayi, S., Pridgen, A., Julien, C., Virtual sensors: Abstracting data from physical sensors (2006) 2006 International Symposium on A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM'06), p. 6. , Buffalo-Niagara Falls, NY pp.-592; Soldatos, J., Kefalakis, N., Hauswirth, M., Serrano, M., Calbimonte, J.P., Riahi, M., Skorin-Kapov, L., Openiot: Open source internet-of-things in the cloud (2015) Interoperability and Open-source Solutions for the Internet of Things, pp. 13-25. , Springer, Cham; Hochrein, T., Alig, I., (2011) Prozessmesstechnik in der Kunststoffaufbereitung, , Vogel Business Media, Würzburg; Yuan, X., Ge, Z., Huang, B., Song, Z., Wang, Y., Semisupervised jitl framework for nonlinear industrial soft sensing based on locally semisupervised weighted PCR (2016) IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 13 (2), pp. 532-541; Aberer, K., Hauswirth, M., Salehi, A., Infrastructure for data processing in large-scale interconnected sensor networks (2007) 2007 International Conference on Mobile Data Management, Mannheim, pp. 198-205. , http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4417143&isnumber=4417107; Feurer, M., Hutter, F., Hyperparameter optimization (2019) Automated Machine Learning. the Springer Series on Challenges in Machine Learning, , In: Hutter F., Kotthoff L., Vanschoren J.

The objective of this study was to use an automated machine learning approach to build a computer vision algorithm for otoscopic diagnosis capable of greater accuracy than trained physicians. This algorithm could be used by primary care providers to facilitate timely referral, triage, and effective treatment. Methods: Otoscopic images were obtained from Google Images (Google Inc., Mountain View, CA), from open access repositories, and within otolaryngology clinics associated with our institution. After preprocessing, 1,366 unique images were uploaded to the Google Cloud Vision AutoML platform (Google Inc.) and annotated with one or more of 14 otologic diagnoses. A consensus set of labels for each otoscopic image was attained, and a multilabel classifier architecture algorithm was trained. The performance of the algorithm on an 89-image test set was compared to the performance of physicians from pediatrics, emergency medicine, otolaryngology, and family medicine. Results: For all diagnoses combined, the average precision (positive predictive value) of the algorithm was 90.9%, and the average recall (sensitivity) was 86.1%. The algorithm made 79 correct diagnoses with an accuracy of 88.7%. The average physician accuracy was 58.9%. Conclusion: We have created a computer vision algorithm using automated machine learning that on average rivals the accuracy of the physicians we tested. Fourteen different otologic diagnoses were analyzed.

However, the involved models usually require complex, tedious and expensive manual intervention. The automated machine learning technology plays a significant role in mitigating this issue. However, the current studies ignore the importance of automation in data preprocessing. In this paper, we propose an efficient automatic training system, AutoTrain, to solve small-scale image classification problems. First, we design sample equalization in data augmentation to improve the performance of training on uneven data. Then, a Bayesian optimization-based strategy controller is introduced to rapidly find the strategy applied in data augmentation. Additionally, we present a dynamic adjustment model to fit tasks with different scales and complexity. Finally, experimental results show that the AutoTrain's training speed is about 3 times faster on average than the conventional methods. And the avergae accuracy of AutoTrain has 2% improved to the conventional methods. © 2020 IEEE.","AutoML; Bayesian optimization; data augmentation; small-scale image classification; transfer learning","Machine learning; Mobile computing; Automated machines; Automatic training; Bayesian optimization; Conventional methods; Data augmentation; Data preprocessing; Dynamic adjustment; Manual intervention; Image classification","Quanming, Y., Mengshuo, W., Hugo, J.E., Isabelle, G., Yi-Qi, H., Yu-Feng, L., Wei-Wei, T., Yang, Y., (2018) Taking Human out of Learning Applications: A Survey on Automated Machine Learning; He, X., Zhao, K., Chu, X., (2019) Automl: A Survey of the Stateof-the-art; Cubuk, E.D., Zoph, B., Mane, D., Vasudevan, V., Le, Q.V., (2018) Autoaugment: Learning Augmentation Policies from Data; Park, D.S., Chan, W., Zhang, Y., Chiu, C.-C., Zoph, B., Cubuk, E.D., Le, Q.V., (2019) Specaugment: A Simple Data Augmentation Method for Automatic Speech Recognition; Xie, Z., Wang, S.I., Li, J., Lévy, D., Nie, A., Jurafsky, D., Ng, A.Y., (2017) Data Noising As Smoothing in Neural Network Language Models; Yu, A.W., Dohan, D., Luong, M.-T., Zhao, R., Chen, K., Norouzi, M., Le, Q.V., (2018) Qanet: Combining Local Convolution with Global Self-attention for Reading Comprehension; Karras, T., Laine, S., Aila, T., A style-based generator architecture for generative adversarial networks (2019) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 4401-4410; Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., Zaremba, W., (2016) Openai Gym; Roh, Y., Heo, G., Whang, S.E., A survey on data collection for machine learning: A big data-ai integration perspective (2019) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering; Krishnan, S., Wu, E., (2019) Alphaclean: Automatic Generation of Data Cleaning Pipelines; Roth, D., Small, K., Interactive feature space construction using semantic information (2009) Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning.

In this work, we propose to exploit multiple AI Planning tools for automating the human expert, generating Machine Learning pipelines automatically. We start from a knowledge about possible valid pipelines encoded as Context-Free Grammar, translate the problem of generating the corresponding language into Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) Planning model, further translate the HTN Planning model into a classical planning model. We use existing planners to produce multiple plans for the classical planning task, translate these plans into Machine Learning pipelines, train and evaluate these pipelines. Based on pipelines' accuracy feedback we update the classical planning model to improve the quality of pipelines obtained in next iterations. Using planning tools allows us to exploit the flexibility of model update instead of solution modification. We present an application that helps users to focus pipelines' exploration process by allowing to encode additional constraints on desired pipelines. Our experimental evaluation shows the feasibility of using planning techniques in this context. Copyright © 2020, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

(2) Methods: We take a design science research approach and select the Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT) as the AutoML method based on a benchmark test and requirements from researcher-physicians. We then integrate TPOT into two artefacts: a web application and a notebook. We evaluate these artefacts with researcher-physicians to examine which approach suits researcher-physicians best. Both artefacts have a similar workflow, but different user interfaces because of a conflict in requirements. (3) Results: Artefact A, a web application, was perceived as better for uploading a dataset and comparing results. Artefact B, a Jupyter notebook, was perceived as better regarding the workflow and being in control of model construction. (4) Conclusions: Thus, a hybrid artefact would be best for researcher-physicians. However, both artefacts missed model explainability and an explanation of variable importance for their created models. Hence, deployment of AutoML technologies in healthcare remains currently limited to the exploratory data analysis phase. © 2020 by the authors.","Applied data science; Automated machine learning; Healthcare analytics; Self-service data science",,"Wang, X., Noor-E-Alam, M., Islam, M., Hasan, M., Germack, H., A Systematic Review on Healthcare Analytics: Application and Theoretical Perspective of Data Mining (2018) Healthcare, 6, p. 54; Chawla, N.V., Davis, D.A., Bringing big data to personalized healthcare: A patient-centered framework (2013) J.

Our approach samples candidate models from the multinomial distribution over the policy vectors. The proposed technique improves the efficiency of architecture search significantly compared to the existing methods while achieving competitive classification accuracy and model compactness. Our policy vectors are easily interpretable throughout the training procedure, which allows analyzing the search progress and the identified architectures. Note that, on the contrary, the black-box characteristics of the conventional methods based on RNN controllers hamper understanding training progress in terms of policy parameter updates.

A core problem in model compression is to determine the layer-wise optimal compression policy, e.g., the layer-wise bit-width in network quantization. Conventional hand-crafted heuristics rely on human experts and are usually sub-optimal, while recent reinforcement learning based approaches can be inefficient during the exploration of the policy space. In this article, we propose Bayesian automatic model compression (BAMC), which leverages non-parametric Bayesian methods to learn the optimal quantization bit-width for each layer of the network. BAMC is trained in a one-shot manner, avoiding the back and forth (re)-training in reinforcement learning based approaches. Experimental results on various datasets validate that our proposed methods can find reasonable quantization policies efficiently with little accuracy drop for the quantized network. © 2007-2012 IEEE.","automatic machine learning; Bayesian learning; explainability; model compression; quantizartion","Bayesian networks; Deep learning; Network layers; Optimization; Reinforcement learning; Automatic machines; Bayesian learning; Explainability; Model compression; Quantizartion; Learning systems","Han, S., Mao, H., Dally, W.J., Deep compression: Compressing deep neural network with pruning, trained quantization and huffman coding (2016) Proc. 4th Int.

Ospedali Riuniti, Ancona, 60020, Italy","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a fast-growing and highly invasive brain tumor, which tends to occur in adults between the ages of 45 and 70 and it accounts for 52 percent of all primary brain tumors. Usually, GBMs are detected by magnetic resonance images (MRI). Among MRI, a fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence produces high quality digital tumor representation. Fast computer-aided detection and segmentation techniques are needed for overcoming subjective medical doctors (MDs) judgment. This study has three main novelties for demonstrating the role of topological features as new set of radiomics features which can be used as pillars of a personalized diagnostic systems of GBM analysis from FLAIR. For the first time topological data analysis is used for analyzing GBM from three complementary perspectives-tumor growth at cell level, temporal evolution of GBM in follow-up period and eventually GBM detection. The second novelty is represented by the definition of a new Shannon-like topological entropy, the so-called Generator Entropy. The third novelty is the combination of topological and textural features for training automatic interpretable machine learning. These novelties are demonstrated by three numerical experiments. Topological Data Analysis of a simplified 2D tumor growth mathematical model had allowed to understand the bio-chemical conditions that facilitate tumor growth-the higher the concentration of chemical nutrients the more virulent the process. Topological data analysis was used for evaluating GBM temporal progression on FLAIR recorded within 90 days following treatment completion and at progression. The experiment had confirmed that persistent entropy is a viable statistics for monitoring GBM evolution during the follow-up period. In the third experiment we developed a novel methodology based on topological and textural features and automatic interpretable machine learning for automatic GBM classification on FLAIR.

NAS methods automate the design of Convolutional Networks (ConvNets) under hardware constraints and they have emerged as key components of AutoML frameworks. However, the NAS problem remains challenging due to the combinatorially large design space and the significant search time (at least 200 GPU-hours). In this article, we alleviate the NAS search cost down to less than 3 hours, while achieving state-of-the-art image classification results under mobile latency constraints. We propose a novel differentiable NAS formulation, namely Single-Path NAS, that uses one single-path over-parameterized ConvNet to encode all architectural decisions based on shared convolutional kernel parameters, hence drastically decreasing the search overhead. Single-Path NAS achieves state-of-the-art top-1 ImageNet accuracy (75.62%), hence outperforming existing mobile NAS methods in similar latency settings ($\sim$80 ms). In particular, we enhance the accuracy-runtime trade-off in differentiable NAS by treating the Squeeze-and-Excitation path as a fully searchable operation with our novel single-path encoding. Our method has an overall cost of only 8 epochs (24 TPU-hours), which is up to 5,000× faster compared to prior work. Moreover, we study how different NAS formulation choices affect the performance of the designed ConvNets. Furthermore, we exploit the efficiency of our method to answer an interesting question: instead of empirically tuning the hyperparameters of the NAS solver (as in prior work), can we automatically find the hyperparameter values that yield the desired accuracy-runtime trade-off (e.g., target runtime for different platforms)? We view our extensive experimental results as a valuable exploration for NAS-based cloud AutoML services, and we open-source our entire codebase at: https://github.com/dstamoulis/single-path-nas. © 2007-2012 IEEE.","AutoML; ConvNets; hardware-aware convnets; Neural architecture search (NAS)","Architecture; Convolution; Economic and social effects; Encoding (symbols); Network architecture; Architectural decision; AutoML; Classification results; Convolutional kernel; Convolutional networks; Hardware constraints; Hyper-parameter optimizations; Neural architectures; Design","Howard, A., Searching for MobileNetV3 (2019) Proc.

However, building an effective machine learning model for a specific task requires not only expertise but also a lot of time and resources. In order to solve this problem, more and more research projects focus on automated machine learning (AutoML). In this paper, we propose an algorithm that can simultaneously optimize the space of multiple datasets, multiple models, and multiple hyperparameters. We call this an automating multi-element subspace exploration algorithm. We first formalize this problem as a reinforcement learning problem and then we define the state, action and well-designed reward function in reinforcement learning system. In addition, we use some skills and experience to accelerate the entire optimization process. Finally, our experimental results on multiple tasks demonstrate that our method is effective. © 2020 IEEE.","AutoML; Hyperparameter optimization; Machine learning; Model selection; Reinforcement learning","Reinforcement learning; Automated machines; Exploration algorithms; Hyperparameters; Machine learning models; Multiple data sets; Multiple tasks; Reward function; Specific tasks; Learning systems","Bengio, Y., Learning deep architectures for AI (2009) Foundations and Trends® in Machine Learning, 2 (1), pp. 1-127; Zoph, B., Le, Q.V., Neural Architecture Search with Reinforcement Learning, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578; Pham, H., Guan, M.Y., Zoph, B., Le, Q.V., Dean, J., Efficient Neural Architecture Search Via Parameter Sharing, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03268, ICML; Ye, X., Ji, K., Sakurai, T., Unsupervised feature selection with correlation and individuality analysis (2016) International Journal of Machine Learning and Computing, 6 (1), pp. 36-41; Hall, M.A., (1999) Feature Selection for Discrete and Numeric Class Machine Learning.; Yu, L., Liu, H., (2003) Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML-03), pp. 856-863. , Feature selection for high-dimensional data: A fast correlation-based flter solution; Forman, G., An extensive empirical study of feature selection metrics for text classifcation (2003) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3, pp. 1289-1305. , Mar (2003); Yang, Y., Pedersen, J.O., A comparative study on feature selection in text categorization (1997) Icml, 97, pp. 412-420; Guo, D., Xiong, H., Atluri, V., Adam, N., Semantic feature selection for object discovery in high-resolution remote sensing imagery (2007) Pacifc-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 71-83. , Springer; Kohavi, R., John, G.H., Wrappers for feature subset selection (1997) Artifcial Intelligence, 97 (1-2). , 1997; Narendra, P.M., Fukunaga, K., A branch and bound algorithm for feature subset selection (1977) IEEE Transactions on Computers, 9, pp. 917-922. , 1977; Sugumaran, V., Muralidharan, V., Ramachandran, K.I., Feature selection using decision tree and classifcation through proximalsupport vector machine for fault diagnostics of roller bearing (2007) Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 21 (2), pp. 930-942. , 2007; Tibshirani, R., Regression shrinkage and selection via the lasso (1996) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

We first introduce a multilevel parallel partition approach that not only partitions by dataflow and centroid, but also by dimension, which unlocks the potential of the hierarchical parallelism in the heterogeneous many-core processor and the system architecture of the supercomputer. The parallel design is able to process large-scale clustering problems with up to 196,608 dimensions and over 160,000 targeting centroids, while maintaining high performance and high scalability. Furthermore, we propose an automatic hyper-parameter determination process for k-means clustering, by automatically generating and executing the clustering tasks with a set of candidate hyper-parameter, and then determining the optimal hyper-parameter using a proposed evaluation method. The proposed auto-clustering solution can not only achieve high performance and scalability for problems with massive high-dimensional data, but also support clustering without sufficient prior knowledge for the number of targeted clusters, which can potentially increase the scope of k-means algorithm to new application areas. © 1990-2012 IEEE.","AutoML; clustering; data partitioning; heterogeneous many-core processor; scheduling; Supercomputer","Cluster analysis; Parallel processing systems; Scalability; Scheduling; Supercomputers; AutoML; clustering; Data partitioning; Heterogeneous many cores; Hierarchical parallelism; High-performance and scalabilities; Hyper-parameter determination; Large scale clustering; K-means clustering","Badoiu, M., Har-Peled, S., Indyk, P., Approximate clustering via core-sets (2002) Proc. 34th Annu.

Therefore, the ability to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of solenoid valves is highly desirable. In this paper, a novel data-driven RUL prediction methodology for solenoid valves is proposed, by training deep neural networks on images constructed from raw current signatures. The performance is compared to shallow machine learning algorithms, trained on features which are obtained using domain expertise on the valves. We show that an ensemble of CNN subnetworks (constructed by the AdaNet algorithm) achieves a predictive performance comparable to the feature-based approaches (p = 0.584 for linear regression, p = 0.321 for Gradient Boosted Regression Trees). By focusing on reducing the modeling effort required for constructing features and fixing neural network architectures, this study offers a new and promising approach for solenoid valve prognostics, and thus even more complex systems in the future. © 2020 IEEE.","AdaNet; alternating current solenoid valve; AutoML; convolutional neural network; prognostics; RUL prediction","Deep neural networks; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Network architecture; Neural networks; Plant shutdowns; Solenoids; Systems engineering; Trees (mathematics); Alternating current; Boosted regression trees; Critical component; Current signatures; Data-driven prognostics; Feature based approaches; Predictive performance; Remaining useful lives; Solenoid valves","Bell, L., (2017) Downtime by the Numbers: The Cost, the Data, and the Benefits of Predictive Maintenance, , http://www.synchron.com, accessed: 2019-08-15; Lei, Y., Li, N., Guo, L., Li, N., Yan, T., Lin, J., Machinery health prognostics: A systematic review from data acquisition to rul prediction (2018) Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 104, pp. 799-834; Guo, W., Cheng, J., Tan, Y., Liu, Q., Solenoid valve fault diagnosis based on genetic optimization mksvm (2018) IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science, 170; Tod, G., Mazaev, T., Eryilmaz, K., Ompusunggu, A.P., Hostens, E., Hoecke, S.V., A convolutional neural network aided physical model improvement for ac solenoid valves diagnosis (2019) 2019 Prognostics and System Health Management Conference (PHM-Paris), pp. 223-227; Wen, L., Li, X., Gao, L., Zhang, Y., A new convolutional neural network-based data-driven fault diagnosis method (2018) IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 65 (7), pp. 5990-5998; Xi, G., Liu, M., Jiang, Z., Soffker, D., Shen, W., Bearing fault diagnosis method based on deep convolutional neural network and random forest ensemble learning (2019) Sensors, 19; Li, Z., Goebel, K., Wu, D., Degradation modeling and remaining useful life prediction of aircraft engines using ensemble learning (2019) Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power, 141; Tang, X., Xiao, M., Liang, Y., Hu, B., Zhang, L., Application of particle filter technique to online prognostics for solenoid valve (2018) Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems, 35 (1), pp. 523-532; Tang, X., Xiao, M., Hu, B., Application of kalman filter to model-based prognostics for solenoid valve (2019) Soft Computing; Cortes, C., Gonzalvo, X., Kuznetsov, V., Mohri, M., Yang, S., Adanet: Adaptive structural learning of artificial neural networks (2017) Proceedings of the 34th International Conference on Machine Learning Vol. 70 of Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, PMLR, pp. 874-883; Taghizadeh, M., Ghaffari, A., Najafi, F., Modeling and identification of a solenoid valve for PWM control applications (2009) Comptes Rendus Mecanique, 3, pp. 131-140; Khan, S., Yairi, T., A review on the application of deep learning in system health management (2018) Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 104, pp. 241-265; Perotti, J., Lucena, A., Burns, B., Smart actuators: Valve health monitor (vhm) system (2006) Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE) Conference Series, 6222; Sateesh Babu, G., Zhao, P., Li, X.-L., Deep convolutional neural network based regression approach for estimation of remaining useful life (2016) Database Systems for Advanced Applications, pp. 214-228; Weill, C., Gonzalvo, J., Kuznetsov, V., Yang, S., Yak, S., Mazzawi, H., Hotaj, E., Cortes, C., Adanet: A scalable and flexible framework for automatically learning ensembles (2019) CoRR, , abs/1905. 00080; Golowich, N., Rakhlin, A., Shamir, O., Size-independent sample complexity of neural networks (2018) Proceedings of the 31st Conference on Learning Theory Vol. 75 of Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, PMLR, pp. 297-299; Ghasemi, S.A., Zahediasl, S., Normality tests for statistical analysis: A guide for non-statisticians (2012) International Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism, 10, pp. 486-489","Proc. - Progn.

Current outlier detection techniques are often manually designed for specific domains, requiring large human efforts of database setup, algorithm selection, and hyper-parameter tuning. To fill this gap, we present PyODDS, an automated end-to-end Python system for Outlier Detection with Database Support, which automatically optimizes an outlier detection pipeline for a new data source at hand. Specifically, we define the search space in the outlier detection pipeline, and produce a search strategy within the given search space. PyODDS enables end-to-end executions based on an Apache Spark backend server and a light-weight database. It also provides unified interfaces and visualizations for users with or without data science or machine learning background. In particular, we demonstrate PyODDS on several real-world datasets, with quantification analysis and visualization results. © 2020 ACM.","Automated Machine Learning; End-to-end System; Open Source Package; Outlier Detection","Data handling; Data mining; Data Science; Database systems; Machine learning; Pipelines; Statistics; Visualization; World Wide Web; Algorithm selection; Automated machines; Data mining applications; Outlier detection systems; Quantification analysis; Real-world datasets; Search strategies; Visualization results; Anomaly detection","Charu, C.A., Outlier analysis (2015) Data Mining.

The most popular IFC is the inner product, which has been successfully used in low-rank matrix factorization. However, interactions in real-world applications can be highly complex. Thus, other operations (such as plus and concatenation), which may potentially offer better performance, have been proposed. Nevertheless, it is still hard for existing IFCs to have consistently good performance across different application scenarios. Motivated by the recent success of automated machine learning (AutoML), we propose in this paper the search for simple neural interaction functions (SIF) in CF. By examining and generalizing existing CF approaches, an expressive SIF search space is designed and represented as a structured multi-layer perceptron. We propose an one-shot search algorithm that simultaneously updates both the architecture and learning parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can be much more efficient than popular AutoML approaches, can obtain much better prediction performance than state-of-the-art CF approaches, and can discover distinct IFCs for different data sets and tasks.1 © 2020 ACM.","automated machine learning; Collaborative Filtering; neural architecture search; recommeder system","Factorization; World Wide Web; Application scenario; Automated machines; Interaction functions; Learning parameters; Multi layer perceptron; Neural interactions; Prediction performance; Search Algorithms; Collaborative filtering","Aggarwal, C., (2017) Recommender Systems: The Textbook, , Springer; Baker, B., Gupta, O., Naik, N., Raskar, R., Designing neural network architectures using reinforcement learning (2017) International Conference on Learning Representations; Bender, G., Kindermans, P., Zoph, B., Vasudevan, V., Le, Q., Understanding and simplifying one-shot architecture search (2018) International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 549-558; Bengio, Y., Gradient-based optimization of hyperparameters (2000) Neural Computation, 12 (8), pp. 1889-1900. , 2000; Bergstra, J., Bengio, Y., Random search for hyper-parameter optimization (2012) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 13, pp. 281-305. , 2012, Feb; Bergstra, J., Komer, B., Eliasmith, C., Yamins, D., Cox, D., Hyperopt: A python library for model selection and hyperparameter optimization (2015) Computational Science & Discovery, 8 (1), p. 014008. , 2015; Blondel, M., Fujino, A., Ueda, N., Ishihata, M., Higher-order factorization machines (2016) Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 3351-3359; Candès, E., Recht, B., Exact matrix completion via convex optimization (2009) Foundations of Computational Mathematics, 9 (6), p. 717. , 2009; Cheng, H.-T., Koc, L., Harmsen, J., Shaked, T., Chandra, T., Aradhye, H., Anderson, G., Ispir, M., Wide & deep learning for recommender systems (2016) Technical Report.

We also identify the potential opportunities and barriers to using AutoML in healthcare, as well as existing applications of AutoML in healthcare. Methods: Published papers, accompanied with code, describing work in the field of AutoML from both a computer science perspective or a biomedical informatics perspective were reviewed. We also provide a short summary of a series of AutoML challenges hosted by ChaLearn. Results: A review of 101 papers in the field of AutoML revealed that these automated techniques can match or improve upon expert human performance in certain machine learning tasks, often in a shorter amount of time. The main limitation of AutoML at this point is the ability to get these systems to work efficiently on a large scale, i.e. beyond small- and medium-size retrospective datasets. Discussion: The utilization of machine learning techniques has the demonstrated potential to improve health outcomes, cut healthcare costs, and advance clinical research. However, most hospitals are not currently deploying machine learning solutions. One reason for this is that health care professionals often lack the machine learning expertise that is necessary to build a successful model, deploy it in production, and integrate it with the clinical workflow. In order to make machine learning techniques easier to apply and to reduce the demand for human experts, automated machine learning (AutoML) has emerged as a growing field that seeks to automatically select, compose, and parametrize machine learning models, so as to achieve optimal performance on a given task and/or dataset. Conclusion: While there have already been some use cases of AutoML in the healthcare field, more work needs to be done in order for there to be widespread adoption of AutoML in healthcare. © 2020 The Authors","Automated machine learning; AutoML; Deep learning; Healthcare; Machine learning","Automation; Clinical research; Deep learning; Health care; Large dataset; Learning algorithms; Automated machines; Automated techniques; AutoML; Biomedical informatics; Health care professionals; Machine learning models; Machine learning techniques; Optimal performance; Learning systems; automated machine learning; bioinformatics; health care; health care personnel; human; machine learning; priority journal; Review","Luo, J., Big data application in biomedical research and health care: a literature review (2016) Biomed Inform Insights, 8. , p.

Methods SD-OCT macular volume scans of a randomly selected subset of 75 SCORE2 study eyes were converted to the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format, and the EZ layer was segmented using nonproprietary software. Segmented layer coordinates were exported and used to generate en face EZ thickness maps. Within the central subfield, the area of EZ defect was measured using manual and semi-automated approaches via a customized workflow in the open-source data analytics platform, Konstanz Information Miner (KNIME). Results A total of 184 volume scans from 74 study eyes were analyzed. The mean±SD area of EZ defect was similar between manual (0.19±0.22 mm2) and semi-automated measurements (0.19±0.21 mm2, p = 0.93; intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.90; average bias = 0.01, 95% confidence interval of limits of agreement -0.18–0.20). Conclusions A customized workflow generated via an open-source data analytics platform that applied machine-learning methods demonstrated reliable measurements of EZ area defect from en face thickness maps. The result of our semi-automated approach were comparable to manual measurements. © 2020 Etheridge et al.

Recently, a growing effort has been made to the development of automatic feature engineering methods, so that the substantial and tedious manual effort can be liberated. However, for industrial tasks, the efficiency and scalability of these methods are still far from satisfactory. In this paper, we proposed a staged method named SAFE (Scalable Automatic Feature Engineering), which can provide excellent efficiency and scalability, along with requisite interpretability and promising performance.

In this paper, we investigated automated machine learning for predicting when vehicles are likely to make such a connection. Using historical data collected from a vehicle tracking service, we assessed the technique's ability to learn and predict when a fleet of 48 vehicles was parked close to charging stations and compared this with two moving average techniques. We found the ability of all three approaches to predict when individual vehicles could potentially connect to charging stations to be comparable, resulting in the same set of 30 vehicles identified as good candidates to participate in a vehicle‐to‐grid service. We concluded that this was due to the relatively small feature set and that machine learning techniques were likely to outperform averaging techniques for more complex feature sets. We also explored the ability of the approaches to predict total vehicle availability and found that automated machine learning achieved the best performance with an accuracy of 91.4%. Such technology would be of value to vehicle‐to‐grid aggregation services. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Each year Markel loses premium because some of their customers choose not to renew their policies. Based on the fact that the cost of attracting new customers is much greater than that of retaining existing customers, it is important for Markel to take early action to engage their customers before a policy expires. The goal in this work is to apply various machine learning methods and obtain an optimal model to predict customer churn rate. The dataset includes customer demographics features, customer behavior features, and macro environmental features. Exploratory analysis is conducted on critical features including policy length and types of coverage to draw insight about the impact of these features on the target variable - customers renew or do not renew their policies. With a large dataset, one of the main challenges is conducting feature dimension reduction and extracting important features to be used with a set of potential ML models. It turns out that the ML model with the best performance on the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric is Extremely Randomized Trees Classifier and Gradient Boosting Model. Some suggestions on additional features to be incorporated are provided in the final comments. These features will improve predictive performance for the ML model of customer churn for Markel Corporation. © 2020 IEEE.","Automated Machine Learning; Customer Churn Prediction; Gradient Boosting Machine; Machine Learning; Neural Network; Random Forest; Support Vector Machine","Forecasting; Insurance; Large dataset; Machine learning; Area under the curves; Customer churn prediction; Customer demographics; Environmental features; Exploratory analysis; Insurance companies; Machine learning methods; Predictive performance; Sales","Burez, J., Van Den Poel, D., (2008) Handling Class Imbalance in Customer Churn Prediction; Effendy Adiwijaya, V., Baizal, Z.K.A., Handling imbalanced data in customer churn prediction using combined sampling and weighted random forest (2014) 2014 2nd International Conference on Information and Communication Technology (ICoICT, pp. 325-330. , Bandung; Vafeiadis, T., Diamantaras, K., Sarigiannidis, G., Chatzisavvas, K., A comparison of machine learning techniques for customer churn prediction (2015) Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory, 55, pp. 1-9; Zhang, R., Li, W., Tan, W., Mo, T., Deep and shallow model for insurance churn prediction service (2017) IEEE Conference Publication; Olson, R.S., Moore, J.H., Tpot: A tree-based pipeline optimization tool for automating machine learning (2019) Automated Machine Learning. the, , Hutter F., Kotthoff L., Vanschoren J.

The manual trial-and-error process for discovering the best neural network configuration consumes plenty of manpower. The neural architecture search (NAS) aims to alleviate this issue by automatically configuring neural networks. Recently, the rapid development of NAS has shown significant achievements. Novel neural network architectures that outperform the state-of-the-art handcrafted networks have been discovered in image classification benchmarks. In this paper, we survey NAS from a technical view.

In AutoML, AI methods are used to generate and optimize machine learning models by automatically engineering features, selecting models, and optimizing hyperparameters. In this paper, we seek to understand what kinds of information influence data scientists' trust in the models produced by AutoML? We operationalize trust as a willingness to deploy a model produced using automated methods. We report results from three studies - qualitative interviews, a controlled experiment, and a card-sorting task - to understand the information needs of data scientists for establishing trust in AutoML systems. We find that including transparency features in an AutoML tool increased user trust and understandability in the tool; and out of all proposed features, model performance metrics and visualizations are the most important information to data scientists when establishing their trust with an AutoML tool. © ACM.","AutoAI;

AutoAI technologies, initially aimed to save data scientists from the low level coding tasks, also has great potential to serve non-technical users such as domain experts and business users to build and deploy machine learning models. Researchers coined it as ""democratizing AI"", where non-technical users are empowered by AutoAI technologies to create and adopt AI models. To realize such promise, AutoAI needs to translate and incorporate the real-world business logic and requirements into the automation. In this Demo, we present a first of its kinds experimental system, IBM AutoAI Playground, that enables non-technical users to define and customize their business goals (e.g., Prediction Time) as constraints. AutoAI then builds models to satisfy those constraints while optimizing for the model performance (e.g., ROC AUC score).

Commonly known as AutoML or AutoAI, these technologies aim to relieve data scientists from the tedious manual work. However, today's AutoAI systems often present only limited to no information about the process of how they select and generate model results. Thus, users often do not understand the process, neither do they trust the outputs. In this short paper, we provide a first user evaluation by 10 data scientists of an experimental system, AutoAIViz, that aims to visualize AutoAI's model generation process. We find that the proposed system helps users to complete the data science tasks, and increases their understanding, toward the goal of increasing trust in the AutoAI system. © ACM.","AutoAI; AutoML; democratizing AI; human-AI collaboration; parallel coordinates; visualization","Automation; Flow visualization; Machine learning; Algorithm selection; AutoAI; AutoML; Experimental system; Feature engineerings; human-AI collaboration; Model generation; Parallel coordinates; User interfaces","Amershi, S., Begel, A., Bird, C., Deline, R., Gall, H., Kamar, E., Nagappan, N., Zimmermann, T., Software engineering for machine learning: A case study (2019) ICSE'19, pp. 291-300. , IEEE Press; Amershi, S., Lee, B., Kapoor, A., Mahajan, R., Christian, B., Human-guided machine learning for fast and accurate network alarm triage (2011) Twenty-Second International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence; Amershi, S., Weld, D., Vorvoreanu, M., Fourney, A., Nushi, B., Collisson, P., Suh, J., Inkpen, K., Guidelines for human-AI interaction (2019) CHI'19, 3. , ACM; Chittaro, L., Ieronutti, L., A visual tool for tracing users' behavior in Virtual Environments (2004) Proceedings of the Working Conference on Advanced Visual Interfaces, pp. 40-47. , ACM; Drozdal, J., Weisz, J., Wang, D., Gaurave, D., Yao, B., Zhao, C., Muller, M., Su, H., Exploring information needs for establishing trust in automated data science systems (2020) IUI'20, , ACM, in press; Gannett, H., Hewes, F.W., General summary showing the rank of states by ratios 1880 (1883) Scribner's Statistical Atlas of the United States Showing by Graphic Methods Their Present Condition and Their Political, Social and Industrial Development, 151. , Hewes FW,(Ed.

This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of predicting H3 K27M mutation status by applying an automated machine learning (autoML) approach to the MR radiomics features of patients with midline gliomas. Methods: This single-institution retrospective study included 100 patients with midline gliomas, including 40 patients with H3 K27M mutations and 60 wild-type patients. Radiomics features were extracted from fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. Prior to autoML analysis, the dataset was randomly stratified into separate 75% training and 25% testing cohorts. The Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT) was applied to optimize the machine learning pipeline and select important radiomics features. We compared the performance of 10 independent TPOT-generated models based on training and testing cohorts using the area under the curve (AUC) and average precision to obtain the final model. An independent cohort of 22 patients was used to validate the best model. Results: Ten prediction models were generated by TPOT, and the accuracy obtained with the best pipeline ranged from 0.788 to 0.867 for the training cohort and from 0.60 to 0.84 for the testing cohort. After comparison, the AUC value and average precision of the final model were 0.903 and 0.911 in the testing cohort, respectively. In the validation set, the AUC was 0.85, and the average precision was 0.855 for the best model. Conclusions: The autoML classifier using radiomics features of conventional MR images provides high discriminatory accuracy in predicting the H3 K27M mutation status of midline glioma. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Computational approaches to the cognitive sciences and to neuroscience are partly premised on the idea that computational simulations of such cognitive functions and brain operations suspected to correspond to them can help to further uncover knowledge about those functions and operations, specifically, how they might work together. These approaches are also partly premised on the idea that empirical neuroscience research, whether following on from such a simulation (as indeed simulation and empirical research are complementary) or otherwise, could help us build better artificially intelligent systems. This is based on the assumption that principles by which the brain seemingly operate, to the extent that it can be understood as computational, should at least be tested as principles for the operation of artificial systems. This paper explores some of the principles of the brain that seem to be responsible for its autonomous, problem-adaptive nature. The brain operating system (BrainOS) explicated here is an introduction to ongoing work aiming to create a robust, integrated model, combining the connectionist paradigm underlying neural networks and the symbolic paradigm underlying much else of AI. BrainOS is an automatic approach that selects the most appropriate model based on the (a) input at hand, (b) prior experience (a history of results of prior problem solving attempts), and (c) world knowledge (represented in the symbolic way and used as a means to explain its approach). It is able to accept diverse and mixed input data types, process histories and objectives, extract knowledge and infer a situational context. BrainOS is designed to be efficient through its ability to not only choose the most suitable learning model but to effectively calibrate it based on the task at hand. © Copyright © 2020 Howard, Chouikhi, Adeel, Dial, Howard and Hussain.","architecture design; artificial intelligence; automatic machine learning; BrainOS; human brain; hyperparameters","Artificial intelligence; Brain; Computational neuroscience; Intelligent systems; Machine learning; Neural networks; Neurology; Architecture designs; Automatic machines; BrainOS; Human brain; Hyperparameters; Problem solving; article; artificial intelligence; human; human experiment; machine learning; nerve cell network; problem solving","Adeel, A., Larijani, H., Ahmadinia, A., Random neural network based novel decision making framework for optimized and autonomous power control in LTE uplink system (2016) Phys.

This demand advocates the new research era concerned with fitting machine learning models fully automatically i.e., AutoML. Automated Machine Learning(AutoML) is an end-to-end process that aims at automating this model development pipeline without any external assistance. First, we provide an insights of AutoML. Second, we delve into the individual segments in the AutoML pipeline and cover their approaches in brief. We also provide a case study on the industrial use and impact of AutoML with a focus on practical applicability in a business context. At last, we conclude with the open research issues, and future research directions. © 2020 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence Meta Learning; Automated Machine Learning; Hyperparameter Optimization",,"Tuggener, L., Amirian, M., Rombach, K., Lörwald, S., Varlet, A., Westermann, C., Stadelmann, T., Automated machine learning in practice: State of the art and recent results (2019) 2019 6th Swiss Conference on Data Science (SDS), pp. 31-36. , IEEE; Simonyan, K., Zisserman, A., (2014) Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-scale Image Recognition; Devlin, J., Chang, M., Lee, K., Toutanova, K., (2018) Bert: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding; Jaykrushna, A., Patel, P., Trivedi, H., Bhatia, J., Linear regression assisted prediction based load balancer for cloud computing 2018 IEEE Punecon, pp. 1-3. , IEEE; Bhatia, J., Mehta, R., Bhavsar, M., Variants of software defined network (SDN) based load balancing in cloud computing: A quick review (2017) International Conference on Future Internet Technologies and Trends, pp. 164-173. , Springer; Mistry, I., Tanwar, S., Tyagi, S., Kumar, N., Blockchain for 5g-enabled IoT for industrial automation: A systematic review, solutions, and challenges (2020) Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 135, p. 106382; Bhatia, J., Modi, Y., Tanwar, S., Bhavsar, M., Software defined vehicular networks: A comprehensive review (2019) International Journal of Communication Systems, 32 (12), p. e4005; Bhatia, J., Dave, R., Bhayani, H., Tanwar, S., Nayyar, A., SDN-based real-time urban traffic analysis in vanet environment (2020) Computer Communications, 149, pp. 162-175; He, X., Zhao, K., Chu, X., (2019) Automl: A Survey of the State-of-the-art; Elshawi, R., Maher, M., Sakr, S., (2019) Automated Machine Learning: State-of-the-art and Open Challenges; Truong, A., Walters, A., Goodsitt, J., Hines, K., Bruss, B., Farivar, R., (2019) Towards Automated Machine Learning: Evaluation and Comparison of Automl Approaches and Tools; Zhang, S., Zhang, C., Yang, Q., Data preparation for data mining (2003) Applied Artificial Intelligence, 17 (5-6), pp. 375-381; Rahm, E., Hai Do, H., Data cleaning: Problems and current approaches (2000) IEEE Data Eng.

Typical approaches separate the design flow into two-stage: (1) designing an application-specific DNN model with high accuracy; (2) building an accelerator considering the DNN specific characteristics. However, it may fails in promising the highest composite score which combines the goals of accuracy and other hardware-related constraints (e.g., latency, energy efficiency) when building a specific neural-network-based system. In this work, we present a single-stage automated framework, YOSO, aiming to generate the optimal solution of software-and-hardware that flexibly balances between the goal of accuracy, power, and QoS. Compared with the two-stage method on the baseline systolic array accelerator and Cifar10 dataset, we achieve 1.42x~2.29x energy or 1.79x~3.07x latency reduction at the same level of precision, for different user-specified energy and latency optimization constraints, respectively. © 2020 EDAA.","Acceleration; Automl; Hardware/Software co-design","Automation; Deep neural networks; Systolic arrays; Tunneling (excavation); Application specific; High-accuracy; Latency optimizations; Latency reduction; Network based systems; Optimal solutions; Software and hardwares; Two-stage methods; Energy efficiency","Hao, C., Zhang, X., FPGA/dnn co-design: An efficient design methodology for iot intelligence on the edge.

This is the first study investigating the future scenarios of soil erosion in Val Camonica and Lake Iseo, which is one of the largest valleys of the central Italian Alps, considering both climate change and land cover transformations. Simulations were done with the Dynamic Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (D-RUSLE) model, which is able to account also for snow cover and land cover dynamics simulated with automatic machine learning. Results confirm that land cover projections, usually ignored in these studies, might have a significant impact on the estimates of future soil erosion. Our scenario analysis for 2100 shows that if the mean annual precipitation does not change significantly and temperature increases no more than 1.5-2.0 °C, then the erosion rate will decrease by 67% for about half of the study area. At the other extreme, if the mean annual precipitation increases by more than 8% and the temperature increases by more than 4.0 °C, then about three-quarters of the study area increases the erosion rate by 92%. What clearly emerges from the study is that regions with higher erosion anomalies (positive and negative) are expected to expand in the future, and their patterns will be modulated by future land transformations. © 2020 by the authors.","Alps; Climate change; Land cover changes; Machine learning; Soil erosion",,"Panagos, P., Borrelli, P., Poesen, J., Ballabio, C., Lugato, E., Meusburger, K., Montanarella, L., Alewell, C., The new assessment of soil loss by water erosion in Europe (2015) Environ.

The experimental prediction of new interactions in BCNs represents a difficult task due to the large number of edges and the complex connectivity patterns. Fortunately we can use another special type of networks to achieve this goal-Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Thus, ANNs could use node descriptors such as Shannon Entropies (Sh) to predict node connectivity for large datasets including complex systems such as BCN. However, the training of a high number of ANNs for BCNs is a time-consuming task. In this work, we propose the use of a method to automatically determine which ANN topology is more efficient for the BCN prediction. Since a network (ANN) is used to predict the connectivity in another network (BCN), this method was entitled Net-Net AutoML. The algorithm uses Sh descriptors for pairs of nodes in BCNs and for ANN predictors of BCNs. Therefore, it is able to predict the efficiency of new ANN topologies to predict BCNs. The current study used a set of 500,470 examples from 10 different ANNs to predict node connectivity in BCNs and 20 features. After testing five Machine Learning classifiers, the best classification model to predict the ability of an ANN to evaluate node interactions in BCNs was provided by Random Forest (mean test AUROC of 0.9991 ± 0.0001, 10-fold cross-validation). Net-Net AutoML algorithms based on entropy descriptors may become a useful tool in the design of automatic expert systems to select ANN topologies for complex biological systems. The scripts and dataset for this project are available in an open GitHub repository. © 2020 by the authors.","Artificial neural networks; Brain connectome networks; Machine learning; Net-net autoML",,"Sandhu, K.S., Li, G., Poh, H.M., Quek, Y.L., Sia, Y.Y., Peh, S.Q., Mulawadi, F.H., Menghi, F., Large-scale functional organization of long-range chromatin interaction networks (2012) Cell Rep, 2, pp. 1207-1219. , [CrossRef] [PubMed]; Gaspar, M.E., Csermely, P., Rigidity and flexibility of biological networks (2012) Brief.

These algorithms have different pros and cons, and no algorithm is the best for all datasets. Hence, a challenging problem consists of choosing the best classification algorithm with its best hyper-parameter settings for a given input dataset. In the last few years, Automated Machine Learning (Auto-ML) has emerged as a promising approach for tackling this problem, by doing a heuristic search in a large space of candidate classification algorithms and their hyper-parameter settings. In this work we propose an improved version of our previous Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) – more precisely, an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm – for the Auto-ML task of automatically selecting the best classifier ensemble and its best hyper-parameter settings for an input dataset. The new version of this EA was compared against its previous version, as well as against a random forest algorithm (a strong ensemble algorithm) and a version of the well-known Auto-ML method Auto-WEKA adapted to search in the same space of classifier ensembles as the proposed EA. In general, in experiments with 21 datasets, the new EA version obtained the best results among all methods in terms of four popular predictive accuracy measures: error rate, precision, recall and F-measure. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Automated Machine Learning (Auto-ML); Classification; Estimation of distribution algorithms; Evolutionary algorithms","Automation; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Heuristic algorithms; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Parameter estimation; Automated machines; Classification algorithm; Classifier ensembles; Ensemble algorithms; Estimation of distribution algorithms; Machine learning literature; Predictive accuracy; Random forest algorithm; Evolutionary algorithms","Zhou, Z.-H., Ensemble Methods: Foundations and Algorithms (2012), 1st edition Chapman & Hall/CRC; Kuncheva, L.I., Classifier ensembles for changing environments (2004) Multiple Classifier Systems, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3077, pp. 1-15. , F.

Three of these methods are based on evolutionary algorithms (EAs), and the other is Auto-WEKA, a well-known AutoML method based on the combined algorithm selection and hyper-parameter optimisation (CASH) approach. The EA-based methods build classification algorithms from a single machine learning paradigm: either decision-tree induction, rule induction, or Bayesian network classification. Auto-WEKA combines algorithm selection and hyper-parameter optimisation to recommend classification algorithms from multiple paradigms. We performed controlled experiments where these four AutoML methods were given the same runtime limit for different values of this limit. In general, the difference in predictive accuracy of the three best AutoML methods was not statistically significant. However, the EA evolving decision-tree induction algorithms has the advantage of producing algorithms that generate interpretable classification models and that are more scalable to large datasets, by comparison with many algorithms from other learning paradigms that can be recommended by Auto-WEKA. We also observed that Auto-WEKA has shown meta-overfitting, a form of overfitting at the meta-learning level, rather than at the base-learning level. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Algorithm recommendation; Automated machine learning; Classification; Evolutionary algorithms; Meta-learning","Bayesian networks; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Evolutionary algorithms; Large dataset; Learning algorithms; Parameter estimation; Bayesian network classification; Classification algorithm; Classification models; Controlled experiment; Decision tree induction; Evolutionary algorithms (EAs); Experimental comparison; Experimental evaluation; Machine learning","Witten, I.H., Frank, E., Hall, M.A., Pal, C.J., (2016) Data mining: practical machine learning tools and techniques, , 4, Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc., San Francisco; Zaki, M.J., Meira, W., Jr., (2020) Data mining and analysis: fundamental concepts and algorithms, , 2, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Michie, D., Spiegelhalter, D.J., Taylor, C.C., Campbell, J., (1994) Machine learning, neural and statistical classification, , (eds), Ellis Horwood, Upper Saddle River; (2002) METAL: Meta-Learning Assistant for Providing User Support in Machine Learning and Data Mining, , http://www.metal-kdd.org; Brazdil, P., Giraud-Carrier, C., Soares, C., Vilalta, R., (2008) Metalearning: applications to data mining, , 1, Springer, Berlin; Vanschoren, J., (2018) Meta-learning: A survey; Thornton, C., Hutter, F., Hoos, H.H., Leyton-Brown, K., Auto-weka: Combined selection and hyperparameter optimization of classification algorithms (2013) Proceedings of the 19Th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, KDD ’13.

In this paper, we use the CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology to model the textile testing process. Real-world data were collected from a Portuguese textile company. Predicting the outcome of a given textile test is beneficial to the company because it can reduce the number of physical samples that are needed to be produced when designing new fabrics. In particular, we target two important textile regression tasks: the tear strength in warp and weft directions. To better focus on feature engineering and data transformations, we adopt an Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) during the modeling stage of the CRISP-DM. Several iterations of the CRISP-DM methodology were employed, using different data preprocessing procedures (e.g., removal of outliers). The best predictive models were achieved after 2 (for warp) and 3 (for weft) CRISP-DM iterations. Copyright © 2020 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

We propose an intuitive, effective, quickly trainable and customizable system for recognizing human activities designed with an automated machine learning method based on Neural Architecture Search. Information from all channels of a 3D video (RGB and depth data, skeleton and context objects) is merged by independently passing these data streams through 2D convolutional neural networks. The outputs of all networks are combined in a summarizing array of class scores using fusion mechanisms that are not computationally intensive but reflect the meaningful information from a video. The proposed system is tested using three public datasets and a new dataset-PRECIS HAR-that was created in our laboratory. In all our experiments, the system is proven to be highly accurate: 98.43% on MSRDailyActivity3D, 91.41% on UTD-MHAD, 90.95% on NTU RGB+D, and 94.38% on our dataset. © 2013 IEEE.","Automated machine learning; context; convolutional neural networks; data fusion; human activity recognition; RGB-D data; skeleton","Convolutional neural networks; Data streams; Machine learning; Pattern recognition; Automated machines; Customizable; Different domains; Fusion mechanism; Highly accurate; Human activities; Human activity recognition; Neural architectures; Human computer interaction","(2017) World Population Ageing 2015, , https://www.un-ilibrary.org/content/publication/88fa44e7-en, Accessed: Jun.6 2020.

Yet the determinism in finding a solution close to the theoretical optimum is low due to human factors in the development process. Automated machine learning (AutoML), on the other hand, allows a complete automation of the machine learning pipeline from feature extraction and preprocessing to model selection and hyperparameter optimization. Using a popular open dataset, this paper exemplifies how AutoML can streamline the development of data-driven industrial applications. As a benchmark, results from existing approaches on the same dataset are used. © 2020 The Authors.","Automated machine learning; AutoML; Machine learning; Machining; Tool monitoring","Automation; Feature extraction; Manufacture; Automated machines; Data driven; Development process; Hyper-parameter optimizations; Model Selection; White-box models; Machine learning","Sze, V., Chen, Y.-H., Emer, J., Suleiman, A., Zhang, Z., Hardware for machine learning: Challenges and opportunities (2017) 2017 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference (CICC), pp. 1-8; Wuest, T., Weimer, D., Irgens, C., Thoben, K.-D., Machine learning in manufacturing: Advantages, challenges, and applications (2016) Production & Manufacturing Research, (1), pp. 23-45; He, X., Zhao, K., Chu, X., (2019) AutoML: A Survey of the State-of-The-Art; https://www.lens.org/; Google Cloud AutoML, , https://cloud.google.com/automl/; Bergstra, J., Bengio, Y., Random search for hyper-parameter optimization (2012) J.

Increased computational power, use of natural language processing, image processing methods made easy creation of rich data. Good domain knowledge is required to build useful models. Uncertainty remains around choosing the right sample data, variables reduction and selection of statistical algorithm. A suitable statistical method coupled with explaining variables is critical for model building and analysis. There are multiple choices around each parameter. An automated system which could help the scientists to select an appropriate data set coupled with learning algorithm will be very useful. A freely available web-based platform, named automated machine learning tool (AMLT), is developed in this study. AMLT will automate the entire model building process. AMLT is equipped with all most commonly used variable selection methods, statistical methods both for supervised and unsupervised learning. AMLT can also do the clustering. AMLT uses statistical principles like R2 to rank the models and automatic test set validation. Tool is validated for connectivity and capability by reproducing two published works. © Science and Information Organization.","Artificial neural networks; Automated machine learning; Drug design; K-means clustering; Market analysis; Naive bayes classification; QSAR; QSPR; R program; Regression models; Shiny web app; Supervised learning; Support vector machines",,"Ananthula, R.S., Madala, K., Strategies for generating less toxic P-selection inhibitors: Pharmacophore modeling, virtual screening and counter pharmacophore screening to remove toxic hits (2008) Journal of molecular graphics & modelling, 27 (4), p. 546; Abdelrahman, M.A., Salama, I., Gomaa, M.S., Elaasser, M.M., Abdel-Aziz, M.M., Soliman, D.H., Design, synthesis and 2D QSAR study of novel pyridine and quinolone hydrazone derivatives as potential antimicrobial and antitubercular agents (2017) Eur J Med Chem, 138, pp. 698-714; Alpaydin, E., (2010) Introduction to machine learning, , MIT Press2nd ed; Biamonte, J., Wittek, P., Pancotti, N., Rebentrost, P., Wiebe, N., Lloyd, S., Quantum machine learning (2017) Nature, 549 (7671), pp. 195-202; Galvan, R.A., A Study of Machine Learning Techniques for Daily Solar Energy Forecasting Using Numerical Weather Models Intelligent Distributed Computing VIII; Gong, G.I., A review on machine learning methods for in silico toxicity prediction (2019) Journal of Environmental Science and Health, 36 (4), pp. 169-191. , Part C; Rt, M.G.S., A user-generated data based approach to enhancing location prediction of financial services in sub-Saharan Africa (2019) Appl Geogr, 105, pp. 25-36; Ch, L.S., Machine learning models based on the dimensionality reduction of standard automated perimetry data for glaucoma diagnosis (2019) Artif Intell Med, 94, pp. 110-116; Machine Learning With K-Means Dimensional Reduction for Predicting Survival Outcomes in Patients With Breast Cancer (2018) Cancer Inform, 17, pp. 1-7; https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/microsimulation/modgen/modgen; Eggensperger, M.F.A.K.K., Efficient and Robust Automated Machine Learning (2015) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 28. , (NIPS 2015)1-9; Jordan, M.I., Machine learning: Trends, perspectives, and prospects (2015) Science, pp. 255-260; Koohy, H., The rise and fall of machine learning methods in biomedical research (2018) F1000Research, 6, pp. 1-16; Vink, R.M.S.P.L.G., Generating missing values for simulation purposes: A multivariate amputation procedure (2018) Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation, 88 (15), pp. 2909-2930; de Silva, A.P., Multiple imputation methods for handling missing values in a longitudinal categorical variable with restrictions on transitions over time: A simulation study BMC Med Res Methodol, 19 (1); Kang, H., The prevention and handling of the missing data (2013) Korean J Anesthesiol, 64 (5), pp. 402-406; Hogan, C.J., Are all biases missing data problems?

However, traditional machine learning methods are very sensitive to their hyperparameters, making the tuning of the machine learning methods essential to improve the prediction performance. Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) approaches are applied attempting to tune hyperparameters, such as grid search and random search. However, the hyperparameters space for workpiece quality prediction model is high dimension and it consists with continuous, combinational and conditional types of hyperparameters, which is difficult to be tuned. In this article, a new automatic machine learning based HPO, named adaptive Tree Pazen Estimator (ATPE), is proposed for workpiece quality prediction in high dimension. In the proposed method, it can iteratively search the best combination of hyperparameters in the automatic way. During the warm-up process for ATPE, it can adaptively adjust the hyperparameter interval to guide the search. The proposed ATPE is tested on sparse stack autoencoder based MNIST and XGBoost based WorkpieceQuality dataset, and the results show that ATPE provides the state-of-the-art performances in high-dimensional space and can search the hyperparameters in reasonable range by comparing with Tree Pazen Estimator, annealing, and random search, showing its potential in the field of workpiece quality prediction. © The Author(s) 2020.","Automatic machine learning;

Although automated machine learning (AutoML) has proved to be successful dealing with the model selection problem in other applications areas, only a few papers have explored the performance of general-purpose AutoML methods, purely based on optimisation, when tackling TF. In this paper, we provide a thorough exploration of the benefits of Auto-sklearn for TF, as a general-purpose AutoML method that follows a hybrid search strategy combining optimisation with meta-learning and ensemble learning. Particularly, we focus on how well Auto-sklearn is able to recommend competitive machine learning pipelines to forecast traffic, modelled as a TF multi-class imbalanced classification problem, along different time horizons at two spatial scales (point and road segment) and two environments (freeway and urban). Concretely, we test the following scenarios: I) a hybrid search strategy with the three components (optimisation, meta-learning, ensemble learning), II) a strategy based on meta-learning and ensemble learning, and III) a strategy based on the estimation of the best performing pipeline from those suggested by the meta-learning. Experimental results show that the meta-learning component of Auto-sklearn does not work properly on TF problems, and on the other hand, that the optimisation does not contribute too much to the final performance of predictions. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Automated machine learning; Computational intelligence; Machine learning; Supervised learning; Traffic Forecasting; Transportation","Forecasting; Information management; Machine learning; Pipelines; Automated machines; Data preprocessing; Ensemble learning; Hybrid search strategies; Imbalanced classification; Model Selection; Model selection problem; Traffic Forecasting; Knowledge based systems","Angarita-Zapata, J.S., Masegosa, A.D., Triguero, I., Evaluating automated machine learning on supervised regression traffic forecasting problems (2020) Computational Intelligence in Emerging Technologies for Engineering Applications.

Automated ML (AutoML) has emerged as a powerful tool for enabling the automatic selection of ML methods and parameter settings for the prediction of biomedical endpoints. Here, we apply the tree-based pipeline optimization tool (TPOT) to predict angiographic diagnoses of coronary artery disease (CAD). With TPOT, ML models are represented as expression trees and optimal pipelines discovered using a stochastic search method called genetic programing. We provide some guidelines for TPOT-based ML pipeline selection and optimization-based on various clinical phenotypes and high-throughput metabolic profiles in the Angiography and Genes Study (ANGES). Results: We analyzed nuclear magnetic resonance-derived lipoprotein and metabolite profiles in the ANGES cohort with a goal to identify the role of non-obstructive CAD patients in CAD diagnostics. We performed a comparative analysis of TPOT-generated ML pipelines with selected ML classifiers, optimized with a grid search approach, applied to two phenotypic CAD profiles. As a result, TPOT-generated ML pipelines that outperformed grid search optimized models across multiple performance metrics including balanced accuracy and area under the precision-recall curve. With the selected models, we demonstrated that the phenotypic profile that distinguishes non-obstructive CAD patients from no CAD patients is associated with higher precision, suggesting a discrepancy in the underlying processes between these phenotypes. © The Author(s) 2019.",,"coronary artery disease; human; machine learning; metabolome; metabolomics; Coronary Artery Disease; Humans; Machine Learning; Metabolome; Metabolomics","Alaa, A.M., van der Schaar, M., (2018) AutoPrognosis: automated clinical prognostic modeling via Bayesian optimization with structured Kernel learning, , arXiv [cs.LG]; Bischl, B., mlr: machine learning in R (2016) J.

Several AutoML methods have been proposed so far, but there is not a single one that really stands out. Furthermore, there is a lack of studies on the characteristics of the fitness landscape of AutoML search spaces. Such analysis may help to understand the performance of different optimization methods for AutoML and how to improve them. This paper adapts classic fitness landscape analysis measures to the context of AutoML. This is a challenging task, as AutoML search spaces include discrete, continuous, categorical and conditional hyperparameters. We propose an ML pipeline representation, a neighborhood definition and a distance metric between pipelines, and use them in the evaluation of the fitness distance correlation (FDC) and the neutrality ratio for a given AutoML search space. Results of FDC are counter-intuitive and require a more in-depth analysis of a range of search spaces. Results of neutrality, in turn, show a strong positive correlation between the mean neutrality ratio and the fitness value. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Automated Machine Learning; Fitness distance correlation; Fitness landscape analysis; Neutrality","Combinatorial optimization; Electric network topology; Machine learning; Automated machines; Distance metrics; Fitness landscape; Fitness landscape analysis; Fitness-distance correlation; In-depth analysis; Optimization method; Positive correlations; Pipelines","van Aardt, W.A., Bosman, A.S., Malan, K.M., Characterising neutrality in neural network error landscapes (2017) Proceedings of the Congress on Evolutionary Computation; Asuncion, A., Newman, D., (2007) UCI Machine Learning Repository; Bosman, A.S., Engelbrecht, A.P., Helbig, M., Progressive gradient walk for neural network fitness landscape analysis (2018) Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference, pp. 1473-1480. , pp., ACM; Bosman, A.S., Engelbrecht, A., Helbig, M., Search space boundaries in neural network error landscape analysis (2016) Proceedings of the Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence; Ekárt, A., Németh, S.Z., A metric for genetic programs and fitness sharing (2000) Eurogp 2000.

Current data availability and growing computational capacities have increased the use of machine learning methods to tackle traffic forecasting, which is mostly modelled as a supervised regression problem. Despite the broad range of machine learning algorithms, there are no baselines to determine what are the most suitable methods and their hyper-parameters configurations to approach the different traffic forecasting regression problems reported in the literature. In machine learning, this is known as the model selection problem, and although automated machine learning methods have proved successful dealing with this problem in other areas, it has hardly been explored in traffic forecasting. In this work, we go deeply into the benefits of automated machine learning in the aforementioned field. To this end, we use Auto-WEKA, a well-known AutoML method, on a subset of families of traffic forecasting regression problems characterised by having loop detectors, as traffic data source, and scales of predictions focused on the point and the road segment levels within freeway and urban environments. The experiments include data from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System and the Madrid City Council. The results show that AutoML methods can provide competitive results for TF with low human intervention. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Automated machine learning; Computational intelligence; Intelligent transportation systems; Machine learning; Supervised learning; Traffic forecasting",,"Angarita-Zapata, J.S., Triguero, I., Masegosa, A.D., A preliminary study on automatic algorithm selection for short-term traffic forecasting (2018) Intelligent Distributed Computing XII, pp. 204-214. , Del Ser J., Osaba E., Bilbao M.N., Sanchez-Medina J.J., Vecchio M., Yang X.S.

The investigated methods include the existing manually engineered model and its modification as well as conventional machines learning algorithms. The use of machine learning allows improving the classification accuracy and recall of the existing manually engineered model from 86.8% and 47.9% to 99.1% and 98.2%, respectively, when using the best performing solution. This solution uses a Random Forest classifier on a set of features based on the filling level at different given time spans. Finally, compared to the baseline existing manually engineered model, the best performing solution also improves the quality of forecasts for emptying time of recycling containers. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Automated machine learning (AutoML); classification algorithms; data mining; emptying detection; grid search; Smart Waste Management","Automation; Classification (of information); Containers; Data mining; Decision trees; Machine learning; Recycling; Waste management; Automated machines; Binary classification; Classification accuracy; Classification algorithm; Conventional machines; Grid search; Random forest classifier; Waste management systems; Learning algorithms","Feurer, M., Klein, A., Eggensperger, K., Springenberg, J., Blum, M., Hutter, F., Efficient and robust automated machine learning (2015) Advances Neural Inf.

Several techniques of such an inspiration have recently shown promising results in automatically designing neural network architectures. However, apart from back-propagation, only a few applications of other learning techniques are used for these purposes. The back-propagation process takes advantage of specific optimization techniques that are best suited to specific application domains (e.g., Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing). Hence, the need for a more general learning approach, namely, a basic algorithm able to make inference in different contexts with distinct properties. In this paper, we deal with the problem from a scientific and epistemological point of view. We believe that this is needed to fully understand the mechanisms and dynamics underlying human learning. To this aim, we define some elementary inference operations and show how modern architectures can be built by a combination of those elementary methods. We analyze each method in different settings and find the best-suited application context for each learning algorithm. Furthermore, we discuss experimental findings and compare them with human learning. The discrepancy is particularly evident between supervised and unsupervised learning. Then, we determine which elementary learning rules are best suited for unsupervised systems, and, finally, we propose some improvements in reinforcement learning architectures. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Automated Machine Learning; Meta Learning; Neural Architecture Search; Reinforcement learning","Inference engines; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Network architecture; Reinforcement learning; Application contexts; Connectionist approach; Elementary methods; Learning techniques; Modern architectures; NAtural language processing; Optimization techniques; Supervised and unsupervised learning; Backpropagation","Biancalana, C., Gasparetti, F., Micarelli, A., Miola, A., Sansonetti, G., Context-aware movie recommendation based on signal processing and machine learning (2011) Proceedings of the 2nd Challenge on Context-Aware Movie Recommendation, CAMRa 2011, pp. 5-10. , ACM, New York; Biancalana, C., Gasparetti, F., Micarelli, A., Sansonetti, G., An approach to social recommendation for context-aware mobile services (2013) ACM Trans.

There is no symptom, no biomarker or test for detection, no therapy, but discontinuation of the drug. Pharmaceutical companies spend huge money, time, and scientific research efforts to test DILI effects and drug efficacy. A preclinical diagnostic support system is designed and proposed for DILI detection and classification on liver biopsy histopathology images. Heterogeneity features and automated machine learning (AutoML) models were tested to classify DILI injury patterns on whole slide image. Fractal and lacunarity values were used to detect hepatocellular necrotic injury patterns caused on a rat liver (in vivo) by 10 drugs at four dose levels. Correlations between fractal and lacunarity values were statistically analyzed for the 10 drugs; the Pearson correlation (r = 0.9809), p-value (1.6612E-06), and R2 (0.9582) were found to be high in the case of carbon tetrachloride. The AutoML model was tested to understand the injury patterns on a subset of 1,277 histology images. The AutoML algorithm was able to classify necrotic injury patterns accurately with an average precision of 98.6% on a score threshold of 0.5. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc, publishers 2020.","automated machine learning; computational biomarker; diagnostic support system; drug-induced liver injury; feature-based DILI detection","biological marker; bromobenzene; carbon tetrachloride; ciprofloxacin; imipramine; iproniazid; isoniazid; ketoconazole; methyldopa; paracetamol; quinidine; rifampicin; algorithm; animal cell; Article; automation; clinical decision support system; controlled study; histopathology; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; machine learning; morphometry; nonhuman; toxic hepatitis","Navarro, V.J., Senior, J.R., Drug-related hepatotoxicity (2006) N Engl J Med, 354, pp. 731-739; Haque, T., Sasatomi, E., Hayashi, P.H., Drug-induced liver injury: Pattern recognition and future directions (2016) Gut Liver, 10, pp. 27-36; Larson, A.M., Polson, J., Fontana, R.J., Acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure: Results of a United States multicenter, prospective study (2005) Hepatology, 42, pp. 1364-1372; Guidance for industry drug-induced liver injury: Premarketing clinical evaluation (2009) Drug Saf, pp. 1-25. , Food and Drug Administration U.

For this purpose, Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT) was developed using strongly typed genetic programing (GP) to recommend an optimized analysis pipeline for the data scientist's prediction problem. However, like other AutoML systems, TPOT may reach computational resource limits when working on big data such as whole-genome expression data. Results: We introduce two new features implemented in TPOT that helps increase the system's scalability: Feature Set Selector (FSS) and Template. FSS provides the option to specify subsets of the features as separate datasets, assuming the signals come from one or more of these specific data subsets. FSS increases TPOT's efficiency in application on big data by slicing the entire dataset into smaller sets of features and allowing GP to select the best subset in the final pipeline. Template enforces type constraints with strongly typed GP and enables the incorporation of FSS at the beginning of each pipeline. Consequently, FSS and Template help reduce TPOT computation time and may provide more interpretable results. Our simulations show TPOT-FSS significantly outperforms a tuned XGBoost model and standard TPOT implementation. We apply TPOT-FSS to real RNA-Seq data from a study of major depressive disorder. Independent of the previous study that identified significant association with depression severity of two modules, TPOT-FSS corroborates that one of the modules is largely predictive of the clinical diagnosis of each individual. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Using data from a textile company, two CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) iterations were executed, aiming to compare three input feature representation strategies related with fabric design and finishing processes. During the modeling stage of CRISP-DM, an Automated ML (AutoML) procedure was used to select the best regression model among six distinct state-of-the-art ML algorithms. A total of nine textile physical properties were modeled (e.g., abrasion, elasticity, pilling). Overall, the simpler yarn representation strategy obtained better predictive results. Moreover, for eight fabric properties (e.g., elasticity, pilling) the addition of finishing features improved the quality of the predictions. The best ML models obtained low predictive errors (from 2% to 7%) and are potentially valuable for the textile company, since they can be used to reduce the number of production attempts (saving time and costs). © 2020, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Machine Learning; Regression; Textile fabrics","Data mining; Design; Elasticity; Machine learning; Physical properties; Regression analysis; Textile industry; Textiles; Weaving; Automated machines; Fabric properties; Finishing process; Predictive error; Regression model; State of the art; Textile designs; Textile physical properties; Textile finishing","Beltran, R., Wang, L., Wang, X., Predicting the pilling propensity of fabrics through artificial neural network modeling (2005) Text.

Here we developed mAML, an ML model-building pipeline, which can automatically and rapidly generate optimized and interpretable models for personalized microbiome-based classification tasks in a reproducible way. The pipeline is deployed on a web-based platform, while the server is user-friendly and flexible and has been designed to be scalable according to the specific requirements. This pipeline exhibits high performance for 13 benchmark datasets including both binary and multi-class classification tasks. In addition, to facilitate the application of mAML and expand the human disease-related microbiome learning repository, we developed GMrepo ML repository (GMrepo Microbiome Learning repository) from the GMrepo database. The repository involves 120 microbiome-based classification tasks for 85 human-disease phenotypes referring to 12 429 metagenomic samples and 38 643 amplicon samples. The mAML pipeline and the GMrepo ML repository are expected to be important resources for researches in microbiology and algorithm developments.

Furthermore, AutoML is compared to manual implementation in a predictive quality use case: AutoML still requires programming knowledge and is outperformed by manual implementation - but sufficient results are available in a shorter timespan. © 2020 The Authors.","Artificial intelligence; Automated ML; AutoML; Benchmarking; Data integration; Data preprocessing; Data science; Hyperparameter tuning; Machine learning; Predictive quality","Manufacture; Predictive analytics; Automated machines; Programming knowledge; Machine learning","Ieracitano, C., Mammone, N., Hussain, A., Morabito, F.C., A novel multi-modal machine learning based approach for automatic classification of EEG recordings in dementia (2020) Neural Networks, 123, p. 176; Usuga Cadavid, J.P., Lamouri, S., Grabot, B., Pellerin, R., Machine learning applied in production planning and control: A state-of-the-art in the era of industry 4.0 (2020) J Intell Manuf; Krauß, J., Dorißen, J., Mende, H., Frye, M., Machine learning and artificial intelligence in production: Application areas and publicly available data sets (2019) Production at the Leading Edge of Technology, p. 493; Krauß, J., Frye, M., Döhler Beck, G.T., Schmitt, R.H., Selection and application of machine learning-algorithms in production quality (2019) Machine Learning for Cyber Physical Systems, 9, p. 46; Hutter, F., Kotthoff, L., Vanschoren, J., (2019) Automated Machine Learning, , Springer International Publishing; Chapman, P., Clinton, J., Keber, R., Khabaza, T., (2000) CRISP-DM 1.0: Step-by-Step Data Mining Guide; Azevedo, A., Santos, M.F., KDD, semma and CRISP-DM: A parallel overview (2008) IADIS European Conference on Data Mining Proceedings; Lenzerini, M., Data integration: A theoretical perspective (2002) Proceedings of the Twenty-First ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART Symposium on Principles of Database Systems - PODS '02, p. 233; (2019) Data Engineering, Preparation, and Labeling for AI 2019: Getting Data Ready for Use in AI and Machine Learning Projects; Han, J., Kamber, M., Pei, J., (2012) Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques, , Amsterdam, Elsevier/Morgan Kaufmann; Kotthoff, L., Thornton, C., Hoos, H.H., Hutter, F., Auto-Weka: Automatic model selection and hyperparameter optimization in WEKA (2019) Automated Machine Learning, 42, p. 81; Langley, P., Lessons for the computational discovery of scientific knowledge (2002) Proceedings of First International Workshop on Data Mining Lessons Learned; Brandstätter, T.C., Krauß, J., Schmitt, R.H., Certification of AI-supported production processes (2019) Production at the Leading Edge of Technology, p. 553; Yao, Q., Wang, M., Chen, Y., Dai, W., Yi-Qi, H., Yu-Feng, L., Wei-Wei, T., Yang, Y., (2018) Taking Human out of Learning Applications: A Survey on Automated Machine Learning; Feurer, M., Klein, A., Eggensperger, K., Springenberg, J.T., Auto-sklearn: Efficient and robust automated machine learning (2019) Automated Machine Learning, 45, p. 113; Smith, M.J., Wedge, R., Veeramachaneni, K., FeatureHub: Towards collaborative data science (2017) 2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA), p. 590; Kanter, J.M., Veeramachaneni, K., Deep feature synthesis: Towards automating data science endeavors (2015) 2015 IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA), p. 1. , 2015; Katz, G., Shin, E.C.R., Song, D., ExploreKit: Automatic feature generation and selection (2016) 2016 IEEE 16th International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM), p. 979. , 2016; Falkner, S., Klein, A., Hutter, F., Bohb: Robust and efficient hyperparameter optimization at scale (2018) Proceedings of the 35th International Conference on Machine Learning, 80, p. 1437; Li, L., Jamieson, K., DeSalvo, G., Rostamizadeh, A., Hyperband: A novel bandit-based approach to hyperparameter optimization (2018) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 18, p. 1","Procedia CIRP",Conference Paper,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092439184

The task is even more challenging considering that the design of features is in many cases problem specific, and thus requires domain-expertise. To overcome these limitations Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) methods seek to automate, with few or no human-intervention, the design of pipelines, i.e., automate the selection of the sequence of methods that have to be applied to the raw data. These methods have the potential to enable non-expert users to use ML, and provide expert users with solutions that they would unlikely consider. In particular, this paper describes AutoML-DSGE – a novel grammar-based framework that adapts Dynamic Structured Grammatical Evolution (DSGE) to the evolution of Scikit-Learn classification pipelines. The experimental results include comparing AutoML-DSGE to another grammar-based AutoML framework, Resilient Classification Pipeline Evolution (RECIPE), and show that the average performance of the classification pipelines generated by AutoML-DSGE is always superior to the average performance of RECIPE; the differences are statistically significant in 3 out of the 10 used datasets. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Automated Machine Learning; Dynamic Structured Grammatical Evolution; Scikit-Learn","Classification (of information); Computational grammars; Data handling; Machine learning; Automated machines; Data preprocessing; Domain expertise; Expert users; Grammatical evolution; Human intervention; Ml algorithms; Pipelines","Pedregosa, F., Scikit-learn: Machine learning in Python (2011) J.

Predicting students' progression and learning outcomes, such as dropout, performance and course grades, is regarded among the most important tasks of the EDM field. Therefore, applying appropriate machine learning algorithms for building accurate predictive models is of outmost importance for both educators and data scientists. Considering the high-dimensional input space and the complexity of machine learning algorithms, the process of building accurate and robust learning models requires advanced data science skills, while is time-consuming and error-prone in most cases. In addition, choosing the proper method for a given problem formulation and configuring the optimal parameters' values for a specific model is a demanding task, whilst it is often very difficult to understand and explain the produced results. In this context, the main purpose of the present study is to examine the potential use of advanced machine learning strategies on educational settings from the perspective of hyperparameter optimization. More specifically, we investigate the effectiveness of automated Machine Learning (autoML) for the task of predicting students' learning outcomes based on their participation in online learning platforms. At the same time, we limit the search space to tree-based and rule-based models in order to achieving transparent and interpretable results. To this end, a plethora of experiments were carried out, revealing that autoML tools achieve consistently superior results. Hopefully our work will help nonexpert users (e.g., educators and instructors) in the field of EDM to conduct experiments with appropriate automated parameter configurations, thus achieving highly accurate and comprehensible results. © 2019 by the authors.","Automatic machine learning; Bayesian optimization; Early performance prediction; Educational data mining",,"Romero, C., Ventura, S., Data mining in education (2013) Wiley Interdiscip.

Bayesian optimization (BO) has shown great promise in HPO, where the parameter evaluation is conducted through a black-box optimization procedure. However, the main drawback of BO lies in the expensive computation cost, which limits its application in large deep models. Hence there is strong motivation to reduce the number of epochs of training required by leveraging the partial information provided by iterative training procedures. Recent advancements use probabilistic models that extrapolate learning curves explicitly to early-stop the training of poor-performing configurations. However, these approaches impose a strong prior assumption on the distribution of learning curves and involve much larger computational complexity or rely heavily on predefined rules, which is not general for different cases. To tackle the challenge of training resource allocation in infinite parameter search space and in time horizon, we study HPO problem in Bayesian contextual bandits setting and derive several fully-dynamic strategies that are information-efficient and scalable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly speed up the HPO process. © 2013 IEEE.","Automated machine learning; Contextual bandits; Hyper parameter optimization","Iterative methods; Optimization; Automated machines; Bayesian optimization; Black-box optimization; Contextual bandits; Hyper-parameter optimizations; Parameter evaluation; Parameter search space; Probabilistic models; Machine learning","Hutter, F., Kotthoff, L., Vanschoren, J., (2018) Automatic Machine Learn-ing: Methods, Systems, Challenges, , http://automl.org/book, Springer; Yao, Q., Wang, M., Chen, Y., Dai, W., Li, Y.-F., Tu, W.-W., Yang, Q., Yu, Y., (2018) Taking Human out of Learning Applications: A Survey on Automated Machine Learning, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.13306; Frazier, P.I., (2018) A Tutorial on Bayesian Optimization, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02811; Eggensperger, K., Feurer, M., Hutter, F., Bergstra, J., Snoek, J., Hoos, H., Leyton-Brown, K., Towards an empirical foundation for assessing Bayesian optimization of hyperparameters (2013) Proc.

However, selecting the most appropriate machine learning algorithm and tuning its hyperparameters to their optimal values remains a difficult task. This is even more difficult for streaming applications where automated approaches are often not available to help during algorithm selection and configuration. This paper proposes the first approach for automated algorithm selection and configuration of stream clustering algorithms. We train an ensemble of different stream clustering algorithms and configurations in parallel and use the best performing configuration to obtain a clustering solution. By drawing new configurations from better performing ones, we are able to improve the ensemble performance over time. In large experiments on real and artificial data we show how our ensemble approach can improve upon default configurations and can also compete with a-posteriori algorithm configuration. Our approach is considerably faster than a-posteriori approaches and applicable in real-time. In addition, it is not limited to stream clustering and can be generalised to all streaming applications, including stream classification and regression. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Algorithm configuration; Algorithm selection; Automated Machine Learning; Data streams; Stream clustering","Automation; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Algorithm configurations; Algorithm selection; Automated algorithms; Clustering solutions; Ensemble approaches; Ensemble performance; Stream classification; Streaming applications; Clustering algorithms","Ackermann, M.R., Märtens, M., Raupach, C., Swierkot, K., Lammersen, C., Sohler, C., StreamKM++: a clustering algorithm for data streams (2012) J.

Recently, automated log analysis has an increasing demand in reservoir research and the oil industry. In this context, Machine Learning (ML) techniques arise as a surrogate model to provide lithology identification in a fast way. However, to achieve suitable performance, ML techniques require the adjustment of some parameters, and that can become a hard task, depending on the difficulty of the problem to be solved. This paper presents an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), assisted by an adaptive Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm to classify petrophysical data in the Southern Provence Basin. The main contribution is searching for a competent ANN configuration, including architecture, activation functions, regularization, and training algorithms. The proposed approach outperformed four classifiers and two results previously published. The computational methodology proposed here is able to assist in the classification of petrophysical data, helping to improve the procedure of reservoir characterization and the idealization of the development of production. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Automated machine learning; Evolutionary algorithms; Lithology identification; Neural networks",,"Abbey, C.P., Okpogo, E.U., Atueyi, I.O., Application of rock physics parameters for lithology and fluid prediction of TN field of niger delta basin, Nigeria (2018) Egypt J Pet, 27 (4), pp. 853-866; Brest, J., Greiner, S., Boskovic, B., Mernik, M., Zumer, V., Self-adapting control parameters in differential evolution: a comparative study on numerical benchmark problems (2006) IEEE Trans Evol Comput, 10 (6), pp. 646-657; Brigaud, B., Vincent, B., Durlet, C., Deconinck, J.F., Blanc, P., Trouiller, A., Acoustic properties of ancient shallow-marine carbonates: effects of depositional environments and diagenetic processes (middle jurassic, paris basin, france) (2010) J Sed Res, 80 (9), pp. 791-807; Burkecampbell, J., Schmidt, A., Jr., The litho-porosity cross plot a method of determining rock characteristics for computation of log data.

Analysis of publications shows that the authors often do not use the full range of possible data transformations and their combinations. Only a part of the transformations is used, limiting the ways to develop high-quality classification models. Purpose: Developing and exploring a generalized approach to building a model, which consists in sequentially passing through the stages of exploratory data analysis, obtaining a basic solution, vectorization, preprocessing, hyperparameter optimization, and modeling. Results: Comparative experiments conducted using a generalized approach for classical machine learning and deep learning algorithms in order to solve the problem of sentiment analysis of short text messages in natural language processing have demonstrated that the classification quality grows from one stage to another. For classical algorithms, such an increase in quality was insignificant, but for deep learning, it was 8% on average at each stage. Additional studies have shown that the use of automatic machine learning which uses classical classification algorithms is comparable in quality to manual model development; however, it takes much longer. The use of transfer learning has a small but positive effect on the classification quality. Practical relevance: The proposed sequential approach can significantly improve the quality of models under development in natural language processing problems. © 2020 Saint Petersburg State University of Aerospace Instrumentation.

The insufficiently effective implementation of human-machine interfaces (HMI) in real-time systems is one of the main risk factors that affect errors and reduce the quality of decisions made by operators. Research and optimization of operator interaction interfaces with systems of spatio-temporal data systems in order to reduce the response time to possible threats and improve the accuracy of decisions is an urgent task. The report proposed new algorithms for evaluating and optimizing the effectiveness of intelligent graphics and natural-languages human-machine interfaces, taking into account the influence of cognitive parameters of operators and their professional knowledge. The OntoProject-Trajectory software package has been developed with the functions of a simulator in an automated environment that supports operator training. The algorithms for simulating the complexes of spatio-temporal data are implemented using hydroacoustic monitoring data as an example.

A timely and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 is the cornerstone for the prompt management of the patients. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the performance of an automated machine learning algorithm in the diagnosis of Covid-19 pneumonia using chest CT scans. Diagnostic performance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and positive predictive value. The method's average precision was 0.932. We suggest that auto-ML platforms help users with limited ML expertise train image recognition models by only uploading the examined dataset and performing some basic settings.

The model was developed using three iterations of the CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology, each focusing on a different regression approach. To reduce the ML analyst effort, an Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) was adopted during the modeling stage of CRISP-DM. The AutoML was set to select the best among six distinct state-of-the-art regression algorithms. Using recent real-world data, the three main regression approaches were compared, showing that the proposed two-stage ML model is competitive and provides interesting predictions to support the laboratory management decisions (e.g., preparation of testing instruments). In particular, the proposed method can accurately predict 70% of the examples under a tolerance of 4 time units. © 2020, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Automated Machine Learning; Industry 4.0; Regression","Data mining; Forecasting; Indium compounds; Instrument testing; Laboratories; Regression analysis; Automated machines; Chemical companies; Cross industry; In-process control; Laboratory management; Quality testing; Regression algorithms; State of the art; Machine learning","Bi, J., Bennett, K.P., Regression error characteristic curves (2003) Fawcett, T., Mishra, N.

Information Systems, University of Minho, Guimarães, Portugal","Automation and scalability are currently two of the main challenges of Machine Learning. This paper proposes an automated and distributed ML framework that automatically trains a supervised learning model and produces predictions independently of the dataset and with minimum human input. The framework was designed for the domain of telecommunications risk management, which often requires supervised learning models that need to be quickly updated by non-ML-experts and trained on vast amounts of data. Thus, the architecture assumes a distributed environment, in order to deal with big data, and Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), to select and tune the ML models. The framework includes several modules: task detection (to detect if classification or regression), data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and deployment. In this paper, we detail the model training module. In order to select the computational technologies to be used in this module, we first analyzed the capabilities of an initial set of five modern AutoML tools: Auto-Keras, Auto-Sklearn, Auto-Weka, H2O AutoML, and TransmogrifAI. Then, we performed a benchmarking of the only two tools that address distributed ML (H2O AutoML and TransmogrifAI). Several comparison experiments were held using three real-world datasets from the telecommunications domain (churn, event forecasting, and fraud detection), allowing us to measure the computational effort and predictive capability of the AutoML tools. © 2020 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

However, non-experts have only contributed features to prediction tasks already posed by experienced ML practitioners. Here we study how non-experts can design prediction tasks themselves, what types of tasks non-experts will design, and whether predictive models can be automatically trained on data sourced for their tasks. We use a crowdsourcing platform where non-experts design predictive tasks that are then categorized and ranked by the crowd. Crowdsourced data are collected for top-ranked tasks and predictive models are then trained and evaluated automatically using those data. We show that individuals without ML experience can collectively construct useful datasets and that predictive models can be learned on these datasets, but challenges remain. The prediction tasks designed by non-experts covered a broad range of domains, from politics and current events to health behavior, demographics, and more. Proper instructions are crucial for non-experts, so we also conducted a randomized trial to understand how different instructions may influence the types of prediction tasks being proposed.

AutoML aims to fully automate the machine learning process end-to-end, democratizing Machine Learning to non-experts and drastically increasing the productivity of expert analysts. So far, most comparisons of AutoML systems focus on quantitative criteria such as predictive performance and execution time. In this paper, we examine AutoML services for predictive modeling tasks from a user's perspective, going beyond predictive performance. We present a wide palette of criteria and dimensions on which to evaluate and compare these services as a user. This qualitative comparative methodology is applied on seven AutoML systems, namely Auger.AI, BigML, H2O's Driverless AI, Darwin, Just Add Data Bio, Rapid- Miner, and Watson. The comparison indicates the strengths and weaknesses of each service, the needs that it covers, the segment of users that is most appropriate for, and the possibilities for improvements. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its author(s).","AutoML; Machine learning services; Qualitative evaluation","Learning systems; Automated machines; AutoML; Comparative methodologies; Driverless; Predictive modeling; Predictive performance; Qualitative evaluations; Quantitative criteria; Machine learning","(2019) Just Add Data Bio, , https://www.jadbio.com/, Gnosis Data Analysis; (2019) Auger.AI, , https://auger.ai/; Bergstra, J.S., Bardenet, R., Bengio, Y., Kégl, B., Algorithms for hyper-parameter optimization (2011) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 24, pp. 2546-2554. , http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4443-algorithms-for-hyper-parameter-optimization.pdf, J.

However, the extra degree of freedom from the neural architecture design makes the design space much larger: it is not only about designing the hardware architecture but also codesigning the neural architecture to fit the hardware architecture. It is difficult for human engineers to exhaust the design space by heuristics. We propose design automation techniques for architecting efficient neural networks given a target hardware platform. We investigate automatically designing specialized and fast models, auto channel pruning, and auto mixed-precision quantization. We demonstrate that such learning-based, automated design achieves superior performance and efficiency than the rule-based human design. Moreover, we shorten the design cycle by 200× than previous work, so that we can afford to design specialized neural network models for different hardware platforms. © 1981-2012 IEEE.","AutoML; Channel Pruning; Efficient Inference; Mixed-Precision; Neural Architecture Search; Quantization; Specialization","Computer aided design; Deep learning; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Energy efficiency; Inference engines; AutoML; Channel Pruning; Efficient Inference; Mixed precision; Neural architectures; Quantization; Specialization; Network architecture","Han, S., Mao, H., Dally, W.J., Deep compression: Compressing deep neural networks with pruning, trained quantization and Huffman coding (2016) Proc.

In this paper, we are contemplating the issue of rise and fall of house rates as a regression problem. Regression is a process that aims to predict the correlation between target dependent feature and a sequence of other changing independent features. In our experimental analysis, we are using Decision Tree Regression, Linear Regression, Ada Boost Regression, Gradient Boost Regression, Random Forest Regression techniques. In addition, we are also used AutoML to predict the House sale price. AutoML is a system that takes labelled trained data as input and automatically build a suitable optimized model that the dataset fits. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

However, existing AutoML methods usually ignore the intrinsic imbalance nature of most real-world datasets and lead to poor performance. For handling imbalanced data, sampling methods have been widely used since their independence of the used algorithms. We propose a method named AutoIDL for selecting the sampling methods as well as classification algorithms simultaneously. Particularly, AutoIDL firstly represents datasets as graphs and extracts their meta-features with a graph embedding method. In addition, meta-targets are identified as pairs of sampling methods and classification algorithms for each imbalanced dataset. Secondly, the user-based collaborative filtering method is employed to train a ranking model based on the meta repository to select appropriate sampling methods and algorithms for a new dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that AutoIDL is effective for automated imbalanced data learning and it outperforms the state-of-the-art AutoML methods. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","AutoML; Collaborative filtering; Imbalanced data","Classification (of information); Data handling; Embeddings; Learning to rank; Classification algorithm; Collaborative filtering methods; Graph embeddings; Imbalanced data; Imbalanced dataset; Poor performance; Real-world datasets; State of the art; Collaborative filtering","Barua, S., Islam, M.M., Yao, X., Murase, K., Mwmote-majority weighted minority oversampling technique for imbalanced data set learning (2012) IEEE Trans.

To fight this threat, actors from both research and industry are constantly innovating to bring concrete solutions to improve security and malware protection. Traditional solutions such as signature-based anti viruses have shown their limits in front of massive proliferation of new malware, which are most often only variants specifically designed to bypass signature-based detection. Accordingly, it paves the way to the emergence of new approaches based on Machine Learning (ML) technics to boost the detection of unknown malware variants. Unfortunately, these solutions are most often underexploited due to the time and resource costs required to adequately fine tune machine learning algorithms. In reality, in the Android community, state-of-the-art studies do not focus on model training, and most often go through an empirical study with a manual process to choose the learning strategy, and/or use default values as parameters to configure ML algorithms. However, in the ML domain, it is well known admitted that to solve efficiently a ML problem, the tunability of hyper-parameters is of the utmost importance. Nevertheless, as soon as the targeted ML problem involves a massive amount of data, there is a strong tension between feasibility of exploring all combinations and accuracy. This tension imposes to automate the search for optimal hyper-parameters applied to ML algorithms, that is not anymore possible to achieve manually. To this end, we propose a generic and scalable solution to automatically both configure and evaluate ML algorithms to efficiently detect Android malware detection systems. Our approach is based on devOps principles and a microservice architecture deployed over a set of nodes to scale and exhaustively test a large number of ML algorithms and hyper-parameters combinations. With our approach, we are able to systematically find the best fit to increase up to 11% the accuracy of two state-of-the-art Android malware detection systems. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2020.","Android; AutoML; Machine learning; Malware","Android (operating system); Computer viruses; Concrete industry; Industrial research; Interoperability; Machine learning; Parameter estimation; Viruses; Android malware; Detection system; Empirical studies; Hyper-parameter; Learning strategy; Scalable solution; Signature based detections; State of the art; Learning algorithms","Global Mobile Data Traffic Forecast Update, 2017– 2022, , https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.mediapost.com/uploads/CiscoForecast.pdf, Accessed 20 042020; http://contagiodump.blogspot.com/, Accessed 12 Sept 2019; Cyber Attacks on Android Devices on the Rise, , https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/2018/11/31255-cyber-attacks-on-android-devices-on-the-rise, Accessed 30 Jan 2020; (2018) Mcafee Mobile Threat Report Q1, , https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/rp-mobile-threat-report-2018.pdf, Accessed 30 Jan 2020; Nomad by Hashicorp, , https://www.nomadproject.io/, Accessed 10 Feb 2020; There are Now 2.5 Billion Active Android Devices-The Verge, , https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18528297/google-io-2019-android-devices-play-store-total-number-statistic-keynote, Accessed 30 Jan 2020; Threat Intelligence Report 2019, , https://networks.nokia.com/solutions/threat-intelligence/infographic, Accessed 30 Jan 2020; Virustotal, , https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload, Accessed 04 Feb 2020; https://virustotal.github.io/yara/, Accessed 04 Feb 2020; (2020), https://www.av-test.org/en/statistics/malware/, Accessed 20 Apr 2020; Aafer, Y., Du, W., Yin, H., Droidapiminer: Mining API-level features for robust malware detection in android (2013) Security and Privacy in Communication Networks (Securecom); Abadi, M., Tensorflow: A system for large-scale machine learning (2016) Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation, , OSDI; Allix, K., Bissyandé, T.F., Klein, J., Le Traon, Y., Androzoo: Collecting millions of android apps for the research community Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR); Allix, K., Bissyandé, T.F., Klein, J., Le Traon, Y., Are your training datasets yet relevant?

One of the Automatized Machine Learning (AutoML) methods, tree-based pipeline optimization technique (TPOT) was used as the key data mining technique in this research. Design/methodology/approach: By considering pipeline attributes, environmental factors and historical pipeline broke/breaks records, a water pipeline failure prediction method is proposed in this research. Regression analysis, genetic algorithm, machine learning, data mining approaches are used to analyze and predict the probability of pipeline failure. TPOT was used as the key data mining technique. A case study was carried out in a specific area in China to investigate the relationships between pipeline broke/breaks and relevant parameters, such as pipeline age, materials, diameter, pipeline density and so on. Findings: By integrating the prediction models for individual pipelines and small research regions, a prediction model is developed to describe the probability of water pipe failures and validated by real data. A high fitting degree is achieved, which means a good potential of using the proposed method in reality as a guideline for identifying areas with high risks and taking proactive measures and optimizing the resources allocation for water supply companies. Originality/value: Different models are developed to have better prediction on regional or individual pipeline. A comparison between the predicted values with real records has shown that a preliminary model has a good potential in predicting the future failure risks. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence;

In this paper, we propose a novel approach called MetaAMC combining meta learning and Auto ML for automatic channel pruning of very deep neural networks. It leverages meta learning and reinforcement learning to provide the model compression policy. Compared to not only the original AMC and MetaPruning but also the state-of-the-art pruning methods, we have demonstrated superior performances on MobileNet V1/V2 and ResNet-50. © 2020 SPIE.","Channel pruning; Deep learning; Image classification; Model compression","Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Image processing; Neural networks; Reinforcement learning; Computation costs; Metalearning; Model compression; Parameterized; Pruning methods; State of the art; Learning systems","Wang, K., Haq: Hardware-aware automated quantization with mixed precision (2019) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; Zhang, X., Efficient and accurate approximations of nonlinear convolutional networks (2015) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; Singh, P., (2019) Play and Prune: Adaptive Filter Pruning for Deep Model Compression; Luo, J.-H., Wu, J., Lin, W., Thinet: A filter level pruning method for deep neural network compression (2017) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision; He, Y., Zhang, X., Sun, J., Channel pruning for accelerating very deep neural networks (2017) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision; He, Y., Amc: Automl for model compression and acceleration on mobile devices (2018) Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV); He, Y., (2018) Soft Filter Pruning for Accelerating Deep Convolutional Neural Networks; Liu, Z., Metapruning: Meta learning for automatic neural network channel pruning (2019) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision; Wang, W., (2019) Cop: Customized Deep Model Compression Via Regularized Correlation-based Filter-level Pruning; Hu, H., (2016) Network Trimming: A Data-driven Neuron Pruning Approach Towards Efficient Deep Architectures; Li, H., (2016) Pruning Filters for Efficient Convnets; Liu, Z., Learning efficient convolutional networks through network slimming (2017) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision; Huang, Z., Wang, N., Data-driven sparse structure selection for deep neural networks (2018) Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV); Lin, S., Towards optimal structured cnn pruning via generative adversarial learning (2019) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; Liu, Z., Metapruning: Meta learning for automatic neural network channel pruning (2019) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision; He, K., Deep residual learning for image recognition (2016) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; Howard, A.G., (2017) Mobilenets: Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks for Mobile Vision Applications; Sandler, M., Mobilenetv2: Inverted residuals and linear bottlenecks (2018) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; Han, S., Learning both weights and connections for efficient neural network (2015) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems; Guo, Y., Yao, A., Chen, Y., Dynamic network surgery for efficient dnns (2016) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems; Aghasi, A., Net-trim: Convex pruning of deep neural networks with performance guarantee (2017) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems; Zhu, M., Gupta, S., (2017) To Prune, or Not to Prune: Exploring the Efficacy of Pruning for Model Compression; Frankle, J., Carbin, M., (2018) The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks; Ravi, S., Larochelle, H., (2016) Optimization As A Model for Few-shot Learning; Elhoseiny, M., Saleh, B., Elgammal, A., Write a classifier: Zero-shot learning using purely textual descriptions (2013) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision; Wang, Y.-X., Hebert, M., Learning to learn: Model regression networks for easy small sample learning (2016) European Conference on Computer Vision, , Springer, Cham; Lemke, C., Budka, M., Gabrys, B., Metalearning: A survey of trends and technologies (2015) Artificial Intelligence Review, 44 (1), pp. 117-130; Ha, D., Dai, A., Le, Q.V., (2016) Hypernetworks; Lin, J., Runtime neural pruning (2017) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems; Yang, T.-J., Netadapt: Platform-aware neural network adaptation for mobile applications (2018) Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV); Zhuang, L., (2018) Rethinking the Value of Network Pruning; Jia, D., Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database (2009) 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.

In this paper, we focus on the AutoML problem from the service provider's perspective, motivated by the following practical consideration: When an AutoML service needs to serve multiple users with multiple devices at the same time, how can we allocate these devices to users in an efficient way? We focus on GP-EI, one of the most popular algorithms for automatic model selection and hyperparameter tuning, used by systems such as Google Vizer. The technical contribution of this paper is the first multi-device, multi-tenant algorithm for GP-EI that is aware of multiple computation devices and multiple users sharing the same set of computation devices. Theoretically, given N users and M devices, we obtain a regret bound of O((MIU(T, K) + M) NM2 ), where MIU(T, K) refers to the maximal incremental uncertainty up to time T for the covariance matrix K. Empirically, we evaluate our algorithm on two applications of automatic model selection, and show that our algorithm significantly outperforms the strategy of serving users independently. Moreover, when multiple computation devices are available, we achieve near-linear speedup when the number of users is much larger than the number of devices. © Copyright 2019 by the author(s).",,"Artificial intelligence; Automatic model selection; Cloud service providers; Hyper-parameter; Linear speed-up; Model Selection; Multiple devices; Service provider; Technical contribution; Covariance matrix","Arora, R., Dekel, O., Tewari, A., Online bandit learning against an adaptive adversary: From regret to policy regret (2012) Proceedings of the 29th International Coference on International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 1747-1754; Audibert, J.-Y., Bubeck, S., Minimax policies for adversarial and stochastic bandits (2009) Conference on Learning Theory, pp. 217-226; Auer, P., Cesa-Bianchi, N., Fischer, P., Finite-time analysis of the multiarmed bandit problem (2002) Machine Learning, 47 (2-3), pp. 235-256; Brochu, E., Cora, V.M., de Freitas, N., (2010) A Tutorial on Bayesian Optimization of Expensive Cost Functions, with Application to Active User Modeling and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning; Bubeck, S., Cesa-Bianchi, N., Regret analysis of stochastic and nonstochastic multi-armed bandit problems (2012) Foundations and Trends® in Machine Learning, 5 (1), pp. 1-122; Bull, A.D., Convergence rates of efficient global optimization algorithms (2011) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 12, pp. 2879-2904. , Oct; Daxberger, E.A., Low, B.K.H., Distributed batch Gaussian process optimization (2017) Proceedings of the 34th International Conference on Machine Learning, 70 of Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, pp. 951-960. , D.

The automated recommendation can be implemented using meta-learning, learning from previous learning experiences, to create a meta-model able to associate a data set to the predictive performance of machine learning algorithms. Although a large number of publications report the use of meta-learning, reproduction and comparison of meta-learning experiments is a difficult task. The literature lacks extensive and comprehensive public tools that enable the reproducible investigation of the different meta-learning approaches. An alternative to deal with this difficulty is to develop a meta-feature extractor package with the main characterization measures, following uniform guidelines that facilitate the use and inclusion of new meta-features. In this paper, we propose two Meta-Feature Extractor (MFE) packages, written in both Python and R, to fill this lack. The packages follow recent frameworks for meta-feature extraction, aiming to facilitate the reproducibility of meta-learning experiments. © 2020 Edesio Alcobaça, Felipe Siqueira, Adriano Rivolli, Luís P.

However, because of its inherent complexity and characteristics, the efficiency and effectiveness of ML algorithm often to be heavily relies on the technical experts' experience and expertise which play a crucial role to optimize hyperparameters of algorithms. Generally, the procedure tuning the exposed hyperparameters of ML algorithm to achieve better performance is called Hyperparameters Optimization. Traditional hyperparameters optimization methods are manually exhaustive search, which is unavailable for high dimensional search spaces and large datasets. Recent automated sequential model-based optimization led to substantial improvements for this problem, whose core idea is fitting a regression model to describe the importance and dependence of algorithm's performance on certain given hyperparameter setting. Sequential model-based algorithm configuration (SMAC) is a the-state-of-art approach, which is specified by four components, Initialize, FitModel, SelectConfigurations, and Intensify. In this article, we propose to add a pruning procedure into SMAC approach, it quantifies the importance of hyperparameters by analyzing the performance of a list of promising configurations and reduces search space by discarding noncritical and bad key hyperparameters. To investigate the impact of pruning for model's performance, we conducted experiments on the configuration space constructed by Auto-Sklearn and compared the effect of run time and pruning ratio with our algorithm. The experiments results verified that, our method made the configuration selected by SMAC more stable and achieved better performance. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","AutoML; hyperparameter optimization; key hyperparameters; pruning; SMAC","Regression analysis; Algorithm's performance; Configuration space; High-dimensional; Inherent complexity; Optimization method; Pruning procedures; Regression model; Technical experts; Large dataset","Hagan, M., Demuth, H., (2014) M, Beale, Neural Network Design, , 2nd ed., Boston, Martin Hagan; Kohavi, R., John, G., (1995), pp. 304-312. , Automatic parameter selection by minimizing estimated error.

While linear models are efficient and intuitive, they generally provide lower prediction accuracies.

Nevertheless, non-expert users might find challenging the use of these techniques due to several reasons, including the lack of enough images, the necessity of trying different models and conducting a thorough comparison of the results obtained with them, and the technical difficulties of employing different libraries, tools and special purpose hardware like GPUs. In this work, we present FrImCla, an open-source and free tool that simplifies the construction of robust models for image classification from a dataset of images, and only using the computer CPU. Given a dataset of annotated images, FrImCla automatically constructs a classification model (both for single-label and multi-label classification problems) by trying several feature extractors (based both on transfer learning and traditional computer vision methods) and machine learning algorithms, and selecting the best combination after a thorough statistical analysis. Thus, this tool can be employed by non-expert users to create accurate models from small datasets of images without requiring any special purpose hardware. In addition, in this paper, we show that FrImCla can be employed to construct accurate models that are close, or even better, to the state-of-the-art models. © 2013 IEEE.","AutoML; deep learning; image classification; transfer learning","Classification (of information); Computer hardware; Deep learning; Image classification; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Program processors; AutoML; Classification models; Learning techniques; Multi label classification; Special purpose hardware; State-of-the-art approach; Technical difficulties; Traditional computers; Transfer learning","Akcay, S., Kundegorski, M.E., Devereux, M., Breckon, T.P., Transfer learning using convolutional neural networks for object classification within X-ray baggage security imagery (2016) Proc.

In most NAS techniques, training of a neural network is considered a separate task or a performance estimation strategy to perform the architecture search. We demonstrate that network architecture and its coefficients can be learned together by unifying concepts of evolutionary search within a population based traditional training process. The consolidation is realised by cleaving the training process into pieces and then put back together in combination with evolution based architecture search operators. We show the competence and versatility of this concept by using datasets from two different domains, CIFAR-10 for image classification and PAMAP2 for human activity recognition. The search is constrained using minimum and maximum bounds on architecture parameters to restrict the size of neural network from becoming too large.

The process of neural architecture design and tuning its hyperparameters remains monotonous, time-consuming, and do not always ensure optimal results. In his regard, the automatic design of machine learning (AutoML) has been widely utilised, and neural architecture search (NAS) has been actively developing in recent years. Despite meaningful advances in the field of NAS, a unified, systematic approach to explore and compare search methods has not been established yet. In this paper, we aim to close this knowledge gap by summarising search decisions and strategies and propose a schematic framework. It applies quantitative and qualitative metrics for prototyping, comparing, and benchmarking the NAS methods. Moreover, our framework enables categorising critical areas to search for better neural architectures. © 2020 for this paper by its authors.","AutoML; Deep neural network; Efficient neural network; Neural architecture search; Scheme modelling","Architecture; Computational linguistics; Deep neural networks; Intelligent systems; Automatic design; Hyperparameters; Knowledge gaps; Neural architectures; Optimal results; Search method; Network architecture","Ghavami, N., Hu, Y., Gibson, E., Bonmati, E., Emberton, M., Moore, C.M., Barratt, D.C., Automatic segmentation of prostate MRI using convolutional neural networks: Investigating the impact of network architecture on the accuracy of volume measurement and MRI-ultrasound registration (2019) Med.

The design of the neural architecture has a large influence on the achievable efficiency and bit error resilience of the network on hardware. Since there are numerous design choices for the architecture of DNNs, with partially opposing effects on the preferred characteristics (such as small error rates at low latency), multi-objective optimization strategies are necessary. In this paper, we develop an evolutionary optimization technique for the automated design of hardware-optimized DNN architectures. For this purpose, we derive a set of inexpensively computable objective functions, which enable the fast evaluation of DNN architectures with respect to their hardware efficiency and error resilience. We observe a strong correlation between predicted error resilience and actual measurements obtained from fault injection simulations. Furthermore, we analyze two different quantization schemes for efficient DNN computation and find one providing a significantly higher error resilience compared to the other. Finally, a comparison of the architectures provided by our algorithm with the popular MobileNetV2 and NASNet-A models reveals an up to seven times improved bit error resilience of our models. We are the first to combine error resilience, efficiency, and performance optimization in a neural architecture search framework. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","AutoML;

Several patients, however, may suffer from postoperative cognitive deterioration. The DBS screening therefore includes an assessment of cognitive functioning prior to DBS surgery. However, these assessments may be influenced by factors such as fatigue or motivation and there is a need for novel biomarkers of cognitive dysfunction to complement the DBS screening. Electroencephalography (EEG) has been previously suggested to identify potential cognitive impairment in PD patients and may have utility during the DBS screening. A limited set of biomarkers (features) from the EEG has been identified for this purpose. Finding new biomarkers is time-consuming and there is no driving hypothesis on which new biomarkers may be important. Based on EEG time series of 40 DBS candidates, this research focuses on automated machine learning techniques to develop EEG-based algorithms for the evaluation of the cognitive function of PD patients. The automated pipeline consists of feature extraction, feature selection, modelling algorithm and optimization. With this approach we extract 794 features from each of the 21 EEG channels which results in a massive feature space. From this feature space the most significant features are selected and used for modelling. The hyperparameters of the model are optimized by a Bayesian technique as part of the automated approach. Aside from the automatically computed features, we also explore the use of features commonly used during clinical evaluation of the EEG, with the result that the model based on automatically computed features achieves a significant higher accuracy (84.0%). The newly identified features are potentially new biomarkers. We used the knowledge gathered from our automated approach to build a hand-crafted model resulting in an accuracy of 91.0%. © 2019 IEEE.","Automated Machine Learning; EEG; Parkin-son's Disease; Time Series Classification","Automation;

In this work, we present machine learning models for forecasting the consumption of electricity. Short-term electric load forecasting has been a fundamental concern in power operation systems for over a century. Energy load forecasting is of even greater importance, due to applications in the planning of demand side management, smart electric vehicles and other smart grid technologies. We use two state-of-the-art automated machine learning systems (auto-sklearn and TPOT), which automate model selection and hyperparameter optimization, to achieve maximum prediction accuracy, and compare their performance for the task of load prediction using two benchmark problems. These benchmarks are derived from real world load consumption tasks, namely household consumption from the UCI data repository and consumption data from an industrial office building. Our experimental results indicate great potential for improving the accuracy of energy consumption prediction by using automated machine learning approaches. © 2019 IEEE.","automated machine learning; energy management; machine learning; short-term load forecasting","Automation; Benchmarking; Electric power plant loads; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Energy management; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Learning systems; Machine learning; Office buildings; Vehicle-to-grid; Automated machines; Energy consumption prediction; Forecasting electricity; Hyper-parameter optimizations; Machine learning models; Short term load forecasting; Short-term electric load forecasting; Smart Grid technologies; Electric load forecasting","Hong, T., Fan, S., Probabilistic electric load forecasting: A tutorial review (2016) International Journal of Forecasting, 32 (3), pp. 914-938. , https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc, eee: intfor: v: 32: y: 2016: i: 3: p: 914-938; Srivastava, A.K., Pandey, A.S., Singh, D., Short-term load forecasting methods: A review (2016) 2016 International Conference on Emerging Trends in Electrical Electronics Sustainable Energy Systems (ICETEESES), pp. 130-138. , March; Baliyan, A., Gaurav, K., Mishra, S.K., A review of short term load forecasting using artificial neural network models (2015) Procedia Computer Science, 48, pp. 121-125. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915006699, international Conference on Computer, Communication and Convergence (ICCC 2015); Staffell, I., Rustomji, M., Maximising the value of electricity storage (2016) Journal of Energy Storage, 8, pp. 212-225. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X1630113X; Alfares, H.K., Nazeeruddin, M., Electric load forecasting: Literature survey and classification of methods (2002) Int.

Such advanced solutions require data scientists with rare (and generally expensive) skill sets. Moreover, such solutions are often perceived as complex black boxes to decision-makers. Automated machine learning tools aim to reduce the expertise gap between the technical teams and stakeholders involved in business data science projects, by reducing the amount of time and specialized skills required to generate predictive models. We systematically benchmarked five automated machine learning tools against seven supervised learning problems of a business nature. Our results suggest that such tools, in fully automated mode, must be used cautiously, only where predictive models support low-impact decisions and do not need to be explainable, and only by data scientists capable to ensure that all phases of the data mining process have been performed adequately. © 2019 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence; Augmented analytics; Automated machine learning; Data science; Decision making; Decision support; Industry; Supervised learning","Advanced Analytics; Artificial intelligence; Automation; Data mining; Data Science; Decision making; Decision support systems; Industry; Nonprofit organization; Supervised learning; Augmented analytics; Automated machines; Data mining process; Decision supports; Non profit organizations; Predictive models; Science projects; Supervised learning problems; Learning systems","Ransbotham, S., Reshaping business with artificial intelligence: Closing the gap between ambition and action (2017) MIT Sloan Management Review, 59 (1); Kaisler, S., Big data: Issues and challenges moving forward (2013) The 46th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences; Waller, M.A., Fawcett, S.E., Data science, predictive analytics, and big data: A revolution that will transform supply chain design and management (2013) Journal of Business Logistics, 34 (2), pp. 77-84; McAfee, A., Brynjolfsson, E., Big data: The management revolution (2012) Harv.

In the last years, many smartphone-based travel mode detection techniques have been proposed, but few explored the usage of dimensionality reduction in conjunction with hyperparameter optimization to improve accuracy with a reduced cost. In this paper, we propose a method to improve the accuracy and computational cost trade-off of travel mode detection, in which use state-of-the-art Feature Engineering and Automated Machine Learning techniques. In addition, we apply the proposed method in a real mobility dataset using different features and parameters. Our experiments showed that the combination of these techniques can greatly improve online detection performance. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Automated machine learning; Feature engineering; Intelligent transportation systems; Smart mobility; Travel mode detection","Automation; Cost engineering; E-learning; Economic and social effects; Intelligent systems; Location based services; Machine learning; Smartphones; Telecommunication services; Automated machines; Computational costs; Context information; Dimensionality reduction; Feature engineerings; Hyper-parameter optimizations; Intelligent transportation systems; Travel modes; Feature extraction","Soares, E.F.S., Quintella, C.A.M.S., Campos, C.A.V., Towards an application for real-time travel mode detection in urban centers (2017), pp. 1-5. , 2017 IEEE 86th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall); Quintella, C.A.M.S., Andrade, L.C.V., Campos, C.A.V., Detecting the transportation mode for context-aware systems using smartphones (2016), pp. 2261-2266. , 2016 IEEE 19th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC); Margaris, D., Vassilakis, C., Exploiting Internet of Things information to enhance venues’ recommendation accuracy (2017) Serv.

As such it is an essential tool not just for the understanding of past human distribution, economy, demography and so on but also for cultural heritage management and protection. The most common type of pedestrian surface survey consists of fieldwalking relatively large tracts of land, recording the dispersion of items of material culture, predominantly pottery fragments, by teams of archaeologists and students. This paper presents the first proof of concept for the automated recording of material culture dispersion across large areas using high resolution drone imagery, photogrammetry and a combination of machine learning and geospatial analysis that can be run using the Google Earth Engine geospatial cloud computing platform. The results show the potential of this technique, under appropriate field circumstances, to produce accurate distribution maps of individual potsherds opening a new horizon for the application of archaeological survey. The paper also discusses current limitations and future developments of this method. © 2019 The Authors","Archaeological survey; Automated site detection; Cloud distributed computing; Drone survey; Landscape archaeology; Machine learning; Photogrammetry","archaeological evidence; detection method; image resolution; machine learning; photogrammetry; survey method","Agapiou, A., Remote sensing heritage in a petabyte-scale: satellite data and heritage Earth Engine© applications (2017) Int.

Existing risk scores either lack specificity at the patient level or utilise the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification, which requires a clinician to review the chart. Methods: We report on the use of machine learning algorithms, specifically random forests, to create a fully automated score that predicts postoperative in-hospital mortality based solely on structured data available at the time of surgery. Electronic health record data from 53 097 surgical patients (2.01% mortality rate) who underwent general anaesthesia between April 1, 2013 and December 10, 2018 in a large US academic medical centre were used to extract 58 preoperative features. Results: Using a random forest classifier we found that automatically obtained preoperative features (area under the curve [AUC] of 0.932, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.910–0.951) outperforms Preoperative Score to Predict Postoperative Mortality (POSPOM) scores (AUC of 0.660, 95% CI 0.598–0.722), Charlson comorbidity scores (AUC of 0.742, 95% CI 0.658–0.812), and ASA physical status (AUC of 0.866, 95% CI 0.829–0.897). Including the ASA physical status with the preoperative features achieves an AUC of 0.936 (95% CI 0.917–0.955). Conclusions: This automated score outperforms the ASA physical status score, the Charlson comorbidity score, and the POSPOM score for predicting in-hospital mortality. Additionally, we integrate this score with a previously published postoperative score to demonstrate the extent to which patient risk changes during the perioperative period. © 2019 British Journal of Anaesthesia","electronic health record; hospital mortality; machine learning; perioperative outcome; risk assessment","adult; algorithm; anesthesiologist; area under the curve; article; Charlson Comorbidity Index; classifier; controlled study; electronic health record; female; general anesthesia; hospital mortality; human; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; patient risk; perioperative period; preoperative evaluation; random forest; risk assessment; surgical mortality; surgical patient; university hospital; adolescent; aged; California; comorbidity; electronic health record; health status; machine learning; middle aged; postoperative complication; preoperative period; risk assessment; risk factor; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; California; Comorbidity; Electronic Health Records; Female; Health Status; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Machine Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Preoperative Period; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Young Adult","Pearse, R.M., Harrison, D.A., James, P., Identification and characterisation of the high-risk surgical population in the United Kingdom (2006) Crit Care, 10, p.

However, manually exploring the complex search spaces is tedious and cannot guarantee to find satisfactory outcomes. Recently, the Efficient Global Optimization (EGO) algorithm for solving the hyper-parameter optimization problem have shown substantial improvements. However, these algorithms cannot easily be expanded to include the selection of an algorithm. Automatically determining and optimizing an algorithm is known as the combined algorithm selection and hyper-parameter optimization (CASH) problem. In this paper, a novel mixed integer efficient global optimization algorithm and its variants are proposed to solve the CASH problem efficiently. The proposed algorithm is compared with a wide set of state-of-the-art algorithms in both a Black Box Optimization and a CASH problem setting. For the CASH problem setup, seven machine learning algorithms are optimized for a large set of classification t asks. Results show that the proposed algorithms outperform on the black box optimization task and can also outperform alternative state-of-the-art approaches on the CASH problem for specific instances. © 2019 IEEE.","algorithm configuration; automatic machine learning; bayesian optimization.","Genetic algorithms; Global optimization; Integer programming; Machine learning; Parameter estimation; Algorithm configurations; Automatic machines; Bayesian optimization; Black-box optimization; Efficient global optimization; Empirical performance; Hyper-parameter optimizations; State-of-the-art algorithms; Learning algorithms","Emmerich, M., Grötzner, M., Groß, B., Schütz, M., Mixed-integer evolution strategy for chemical plant optimization with simulators (2000) Evolutionary Design and Manufacture, pp. 55-67. , Springer; Mack, Y., Goel, T., Shyy, W., Haftka, R., Surrogate model-based optimization framework: A case study in aerospace design (2007) Evolutionary Computation in Dynamic and Uncertain Environments, pp. 323-342. , Springer; Booker, A.J., Dennis, J., Frank, P.D., Serafini, D.B., Torczon, V., Optimization using surrogate objectives on a helicopter test example (1998) Computational Methods for Optimal Design and Control, pp. 49-58. , Springer; Andradóttir, S., Simulation optimization (1998) Handbook of Simulation: Principles, Methodology, Advances, Applications, and Practice, pp. 307-333; Simpson, T.W., Mauery, T.M., Korte, J.J., Mistree, F., Kriging models for global approximation in simulation-based multidisciplinary design optimization (2001) AIAA Journal, 39 (12), pp. 2233-2241; Sacks, J., Welch, W.J., Mitchell, T.J., Wynn, H.P., Design and analysis of computer experiments (1989) Statistical Science, pp. 409-423; Thornton, C., Hutter, F., Hoos, H.H., Leyton-Brown, K., Auto-weka: Combined selection and hyperparameter optimization of classification algorithms (2013) Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining.

Prior work focused on using communication volume to estimate broad relationship categories, often with small samples. Here we contextualize communications by combining phone logs with demographic and location data to predict interpersonal relationship roles on a varied sample population using automated machine learning methods, producing better performance (F 1 = 0.68) than using communication features alone (F 1 = 0.62). We also explore the effect of age variation in the underlying training sample on interpersonal relationship prediction and find that models trained on younger subgroups, which is popular in the field via student participation and recruitment, generalize poorly to the wider population. Our results not only illustrate the value of using data across demographics, communication patterns and semantic locations for relationship prediction, but also underscore the importance of considering population heterogeneity in phone-based personal sensing studies.

However, conflict research- the empirical examination of political unrest, violence and civil war-has seen a growing emphasis on prediction and forecasting models. We describe automated machine learning (AutoML) to identify models, and human-guided machine learning (HGML), and show how these can incorporate domain knowledge and research requirements into model selection and assessment, and provide high quality machine learning pipelines to domain experts comparable to state-of-the-literature solutions. We examine three peer-reviewed papers with predictive models of conflict [3, 4, 5] and run their data through our HGML system using multiple AutoML engines and find this system produces slightly elevated performance on each paper's model, without any ML expertise required of the user. Our research has three takeaways for computational social science. First, predictive models of conflict would benefit from even minimal applications of AutoML; Secondly, human-guided machine learning offers the attractive option of constraining AutoML systems to address the kinds of questions conflict researchers assess with predictive models; Finally, current existing AutoML implementations produce divergent solutions and so can be productively harnessed in parallel. © 2019 IEEE.","Automated machine learning (AutoML); conflict forecasting; Human-guided machine learning","Behavioral research; Big data; Forecasting; Automated machines; Computational social science; Divergent solution; Domain knowledge; Empirical examination; Modeling and forecasting; Prediction and forecasting; Predictive models; Machine learning","Wallach, H., Computational social science = computer science + social data (2018) Communications of the ACM, 61 (3), pp. 42-44; King, G., Big data is not about the data!

Therefore, the detection of the travel modes and the prediction of trips, purposes from smartphone sensors data emerged as two research problems in recent years. Most previous works have tackled these problems in separate studies, leading to an unnecessary redundancy with respect to the preprocessing steps taken. In this paper, we propose the use of a single preprocessing algorithm for both problems, using location traces obtained through smartphone sensors. The proposed technique applies multiple preprocessing steps to extract relevant features for both classification tasks and uses automated machine learning methods to identify the best classifiers and its hyperparameter configurations for each one of them. During evaluation experiments conducted with real smartphones data, a maximum accuracy of 88% for travel mode detection and 81% for trip purpose prediction were reached using our technique. © 2019 IEEE.","automated machine learning; context-aware applications; intelligent transportation systems; knowledge discovery; Travel mode detection; trip purpose prediction","Data mining; Intelligent systems; Machine learning; Smartphones; Automated machines; Classification tasks; Context aware applications; Evaluation experiments; Intelligent transportation systems; Pre-processing algorithms; Pre-processing step; Travel modes; Forecasting","Ganti, R.K., Ye, F., Lei, H., Mobile crowdsensing: Current state and future challenges (2011) IEEE Commun.

Our method leverages empirical and theoretical results characterizing the shape of the generalization error curve for increasing training data size and number of epochs. We show that with relatively small computational resources one can estimate the dominant parameters of neural networks' learning curves to obtain consistently good evaluations of their learning process to reliably early-eliminate non-promising configurations. By iterating this process with increasing training resources Ordalia rapidly converges to a small candidate set that includes many of the most promising configurations. We compare the performance of Ordalia with Hyperband, the state-of-the-art model-free hyperparameter optimization algorithm, and show that Ordalia consistently outperforms it on a variety of deep learning tasks. Ordalia conservative use of computational resources and ability to evaluate neural networks learning progress leads to a much better exploration and coverage of the search space, which ultimately produces superior neural network configurations. © 2019 IEEE.","Automated Machine Learning; Deep Learning; Hyperparameters Optimization; Multi-armed Bandits","Big data; Error analysis; Learning systems; Automated machines; Computational resources; Generalization Error; Generalization error bounds; Hyper-parameter optimizations; Hyperparameters; Multi armed bandit; Neural network configurations; Deep learning","Li, L., (2016) Hyperband: A Novel Bandit-based Approach to Hyperparameter Optimization, , arXiv preprint arXiv: 1603.06560; Hutter, F., Hoos, H.H., Leyton-Brown, K., Sequential modelbased optimization for general algorithm configuration (2011) International Conference on Learning and Intelligent Optimization, pp. 507-523. , Springer; Bergstra, J.S., Bardenet, R., Bengio, Y., Kegl, B., Algorithms for hyper-parameter optimization (2011) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 24, pp. 2546-2554. , http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4443-algorithms-for-hyper-parameter-optimization.pdf, J.

They are frequently used for high-throughput screening owing to their high fecundity. Peripheral experimental equipment and analytical software are required for zebrafish screening, which need to be further developed. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for large-scale image analysis and has been applied in zebrafish research as well. However, its use by individual researchers is restricted due to the cost and the procedure of machine learning for specific research purposes. Methods: We developed a simple and easy method for zebrafish image analysis, particularly fluorescent labelled ones, using the free machine learning program Google AutoML. We performed machine learning using vascular-and macrophage-Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) fishes under normal and abnormal conditions (treated with anti-angiogenesis drugs or by wounding the caudal fin). Then, we tested the system using a new set of zebrafish images. Results: While machine learning can detect abnormalities in the fish in both strains with more than 95% accuracy, the learning procedure needs image pre-processing for the images of the macrophage-EGFP fishes. In addition, we developed a batch uploading software, ZF-ImageR, for Windows (.exe) and MacOS (.app) to enable high-throughput analysis using AutoML. Conclusions: We established a protocol to utilize conventional machine learning platforms for analyzing zebrafish phenotypes, which enables fluorescence-based, phenotype-driven zebrafish screening. © 2019 by the authors.

However, such collaborations often face challenges. In this paper, we aim to decipher this collaboration complexity through a semi-structured interview study with 22 interviewees from teams of bio-medical scientists collaborating with data scientists. In the analysis, we adopt the Olsons' four-dimensions framework proposed in Distance Matters to code interview transcripts. Our findings suggest that besides the glitches in the collaboration readiness, technology readiness, and coupling of work dimensions, the tensions that exist in the common ground building process influence the collaboration outcomes, and then persist in the actual collaboration process. In contrast to prior works' general account of building a high level of common ground, the breakdowns of content common ground together with the strengthen of process common ground in this process is more beneficial for scientific discovery. We discuss why that is and what the design suggestions are, and conclude the paper with future directions and limitations. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

One of the main challenges non-experts face in applying machine learning to new problems is algorithm selection - the identification of the algorithm(s) that will deliver top performance for a given dataset, task, and evaluation measure. We present AutoGRD, a novel meta-learning approach for algorithm recommendation. AutoGRD first represents datasets as graphs and then extracts their latent representation that is used to train a ranking meta-model capable of accurately recommending top-performing algorithms for previously unseen datasets. We evaluate our approach on 250 datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness both for classification and regression tasks. AutoGRD outperforms state-of-the-art meta-learning and Bayesian methods. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Algorithm selection; AutoML; Classification; Dataset representation; Graph embedding; Meta-learning; Regression","Bayesian networks; Classification (of information); Genetic algorithms; Knowledge management; Machine learning; Algorithm selection; AutoML; Dataset representation; Graph embeddings; Metalearning; Regression; Learning algorithms","Bensusan, H., Giraud-Carrier, C., (2000) Discovering Task Neighbourhoods through Landmark Learning Performances (PKDD'00), pp. 325-330; Brazdil, P., Giraud-Carrier, C., Soares, C., Vilalta, R., (2008) Metalearning: Applications to Data Mining, , Springer Publishing Company, Incorporated; Brazdil, P.B., Soares, C., Da Costa, J.P., Ranking learning algorithms: Using IBL and meta-learning on accuracy and time results (2003) Machine Learning, 50 (3), pp. 251-277. , 2003; Cao, Z., Qin, T., Liu, T.-Y., Tsai, M.-F., Li, H., (2007) Learning to Rank: From Pairwise Approach to Listwise Approach (ICML'07), pp. 129-136; Cavallari, S., Zheng, V.W., Cai, H., Chang, K.C.-C., Cambria, E., (2017) Learning Community Embedding with Community Detection and Node Embedding on Graphs (CIKM'17), pp. 377-386; Chen, T., Guestrin, C., (2016) XGBoost: A Scalable Tree Boosting System, , CoRR abs/1603.02754 2016; Das Dôres, S.N., Alves, L., Ruiz, D.D., Barros, R.C., (2016) A Meta-Learning Framework for Algorithm Recommendation in Software Fault Prediction (SAC'16), pp. 1486-1491; Dean, J., Ghemawat, S., MapReduce: Simplified data processing on large clusters (2008) Commun.

Safety of railway networks is the top priority in the railroad industry, and track defects are a common cause of train accidents and service disruptions around the world. Effective classification and prediction of these defects based on historical inspection data can help in planning maintenance activities before critical defects occur. This increases safety of the network and lowers costs of the maintenance.

ML engineers, as a consequence, are in high demand across the industry, yet improving the efficiency of ML engineers remains a fundamental challenge. Automated machine learning (AutoML) has emerged as a way to save time and effort on repetitive tasks in ML pipelines, such as data pre-processing, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter optimization, and prediction result analysis. In this paper, we investigate the current state of AutoML tools aiming to automate these tasks. We conduct various evaluations of the tools on many datasets, in different data segments, to examine their performance, and compare their advantages and disadvantages on different test cases. © 2019 IEEE.","Automated machine learning; AutoML; Driverless AI; Hyperparameter optimization; Model selection","Automation; Data handling; Automated machines; AutoML; Driverless; Hyper-parameter optimizations; Model Selection; Machine learning","Kotthoff, L., Thornton, C., Hoos, H.H., Hutter, F., Leyton-Brown, K., Auto-weka 2. 0: Automatic model selection and hyperparameter optimization in weka (2017) The Journal of Machine Learning Research, 18 (1), pp. 826-830. , Jan; Hall, M., Frank, E., Holmes, G., Pfahringer, B., Reutemann, P., Witten, I.H., The weka data mining software: An update (2009) ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter, 11 (1), pp. 10-18; Feurer, M., Klein, A., Eggensperger, K., Springenberg, J., Blum, M., Hutter, F., Efficient and robust automated machine learning (2015) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28, pp. 2962-2970; Olson, R.S., Bartley, N., Urbanowicz, R.J., Moore, J.H., Evaluation of a tree-based pipeline optimization tool for automating data science (2016) Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO) 2016, pp. 485-492. , New York, NY, USA: ACM; Auto-ml: Automated Machine Learning for Production and Analytics, , https://github.com/ClimbsRocks/automl, accessed: 2019-04-10; Jin, H., Song, Q., Hu, X., (2018) Auto-keras: An Efficient Neural Architecture Search System, , arXiv; https://github.com/mljar/mljar-api-python, accessed: 2019-04-10; Datarobot Usage Examples, , https://github.com/datarobot/datarobotsagemaker-examples, accessed: 2019-04-10; Datarobot Documentation, , https://www.datarobot.com/about-us/, accessed: 2019-04-10; Datarobot Python Client, , https://datarobot-public-apiclient.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/v2.11.0/setup/gettingstarted.html, accessed: 2019-04-10; H2o.

However, identification usually requires the involvement of experts. It would be useful to develop means to support pest identification. Although machine learning techniques have been applied to multiple fields including pest identification, expert knowledge for modeling was required to construct a high-accuracy model. In recent years, machine learning platforms that automatically construct a model are offered by IT firms. We tested whether automated machine learning using Google Cloud AutoML Vision was useful for identifying pest species. We trained machine learning models to identify aphids of three species—Aphis craccivora Koch, Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris, and Megoura crassicauda Mordivilko (Hemiptera: Aphididae)—sharing host plants and assessed accuracies. Models were constructed using 20, 50, 100, 200, and 400 images per species, with and without augmentation of training data volume by image inversion. The accuracy of identification increased with the number of training images and with the use of inverted images. Since the rates of correct identification were > 0.96 when the models were trained with 400 images per species with inversion, we consider automated machine learning to be useful for pest species identification. © 2019, The Japanese Society of Applied Entomology and Zoology.","Aphid; Automated machine learning; AutoML; Image analysis; Pest identification",,"Ataş, M., Yardimci, Y., Temizel, A., A new approach to aflatoxin detection in chili pepper by machine vision (2012) Comput Electron Agric, 87, pp. 129-141; Behmann, J., Mahlein, A.K., Rumpf, T., Römer, C., Plümer, L., A review of advanced machine learning methods for the detection of biotic stress in precision crop protection (2015) Precis Agric, 16, pp. 239-260; Bishop, C.M., (2006) Pattern recognition and machine learning, , Springer, Berlin; Chlingaryan, A., Sukkarieh, S., Whelan, B., Machine learning approaches for crop yield prediction and nitrogen status estimation in precision agriculture: a review (2018) Comput Electron Agric, 151, pp. 61-69; Cruz, A., Ampatzidis, Y., Pierro, R., Materazzi, A., Panattoni, A., De Bellis, L., Luvisi, A., Detection of grapevine yellows symptoms in Vitis vinifera L. with artificial intelligence (2019) Comput Electron Agric, 157, pp. 63-76; Ding, W., Taylor, G., Automatic moth detection from trap images for pest management (2016) Comput Electron Agric, 123, pp. 17-28; Feng, P., Wang, B., Li Liu, D., Yu, Q., Machine learning-based integration of remotely-sensed drought factors can improve the estimation of agricultural drought in South-Eastern Australia (2019) Agric Syst, 173, pp. 303-316; Feurer, M., Klein, A., Eggensperger, K., Springenberg, J., Blum, M., Hutter, F., Efficient and robust automated machine learning (2015) Adv Neural Inf Process Syst, 28, pp. 2962-2970; Gaston, K.J., O’Neill, M.A., Automated species identification: why not?

Material and methods: This retrospective study includes 99 pregnant women with pathologically confirmed placental invasion and 56 pregnant women with simple placenta previa. All participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging after 24 gestational weeks. The placenta was segmented in sagittal images from both turbo spin echo (TSE) and balanced turbo field echo (bTFE) sequences. Textural features were extracted from the both original and Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG)-filtered MRI images. An automated machine learning algorithm was applied to the extracted feature sets to obtain the optimal preprocessing steps, classification algorithm, and corresponding hyper-parameters. Results: A gradient boosting classifier using all textual features from original and LoG-filtered TSE images and bTFE images identified by the automated machine learning algorithm achieved the optimal performance with sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under ROC curve (AUC) of 100%, 88.5%, 95.2%, and 0.98 in the prediction of placental invasion. In addition, textural features that contributed to the prediction of placental invasion differ from the features significantly affected by normal placenta maturation. Conclusions: Quantifying intraplacental heterogeneity using LoG filtration and texture analysis highlights the different heterogeneous appearance caused by abnormal placentation relative to normal maturation. The predictive model derived from automated machine learning yielded good performance, indicating the proposed radiomic analysis pipeline can accurately predict placental invasion and facilitate clinical decision-making for pregnant women with suspicious placental invasion. Key Points: • The intraplacental texture features have high efficiency in prediction of invasive placentation after 24 gestational weeks. • The features with dominated predictive power did not overlap with the features significantly affected by gestational age. © 2019, European Society of Radiology.","Computer-assisted image analysis; Machine learning; Magnetic resonance imaging; Placenta accreta; Radiomics","adult; algorithm; analysis; Article; balanced turbo field echo; female; gestational age; human; machine learning; major clinical study; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; placenta disorder; placental invasion; pregnant woman; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; turbo spin echo; algorithm; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; physiology; placenta; placenta development; placenta previa; pregnancy; prenatal diagnosis; procedures; young adult; Adult; Algorithms; Female; Humans; Machine Learning; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Placenta; Placenta Previa; Placentation; Pregnancy; Prenatal Diagnosis; Retrospective Studies; Young Adult","Oyelese, Y., Smulian, J.C., Placenta previa, placenta accreta, and vasa previa (2006) Obstet Gynecol, 107, pp. 927-941; Garmi, G., Salim, R., Epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and management of placenta accreta (2012) Obstet Gynecol Int, 2012, pp. 1-7; Baughman, W.C., Corteville, J.E., Shah, R.R., Placenta accreta: spectrum of US and MR imaging findings (2008) Radiographics, 28, pp. 1905-1916; Kocher, M.R., Sheafor, D.H., Bruner, E., Diagnosis of abnormally invasive posterior placentation: the role of MR imaging (2017) Radiol Case Rep, 12, pp. 295-299; Delli Pizzi, A., Tavoletta, A., Narciso, R., Prenatal planning of placenta previa: diagnostic accuracy of a novel MRI-based prediction model for placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) and clinical outcome (2019) Abdom Radiol, 44, pp. 1873-1882; D’Antonio, F., Iacovella, C., Palacios-Jaraquemada, J., Prenatal identification of invasive placentation using magnetic resonance imaging: systematic review and meta-analysis (2014) Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol, 44, pp. 8-16; Alamo, L., Anaye, A., Rey, J., Detection of suspected placental invasion by MRI: do the results depend on observer’ experience?

In practice, conducting this process efficiently requires solid knowledge and experience with the various techniques that can be employed. With the continuous and vast increase of the amount of data in our digital world, it has been acknowledged that the number of knowledgeable data scientists can not scale to address these challenges. Thus, there is a crucial need for automating the process of Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyper-parameter tuning (CASH) in the machine learning domain. Recently, several systems (e.g., AutoWeka, AutoSKLearn, SmartML) have been introduced to tackle this challenge with the main aim of reducing the role of human in the loop and filling the gap for non-expert machine learning users by playing the role of the data scientist. Meta-Learning is described as the process of learning from previous experience gained during applying various learning algorithms on different types of data, and hence reducing the needed time to learn new tasks. In the context of the Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) process, one main advantage of meta-learning techniques is that they allow hand-engineered algorithms to be replaced with novel automated methods which are designed in a data-driven way. In this paper, we present a methodology and framework for using Meta-Learning techniques to develop new methods that serve as an effective decision support for the AutoML process. In particular, we use Meta-Learning techniques to answer several crucial questions for the AutoML process including: 1) Which classifiers are expected to be the best performing on a given dataset? 2) Can we predict the training time of a classifier? 3) Which classifiers are worth investing a larger portion of the time budget to improve their performance by tuning them? In our Meta-Learning process, we used 200 datasets with different characteristics on a wide set of metafeatures. In addition, we used 30 classifiers from two popular machine learning libraries, namely, Weka and Scikit-learn. Our results and Meta-Models have been obtained in a fully automated way. The methodology and results of our framework can be easily embeded/utilized by any AutoML system. © 2019 IEEE.","Automated machine learning; Meta learning","Automation; Budget control; Classification (of information); Data mining; Decision support systems; Iterative methods; Machine learning; Parameter estimation; Automated machines; Decision support framework; Knowledge and experience; Machine learning models; Meta-learning approach; Meta-learning techniques; Metalearning; Process of learning; Learning algorithms","Thornton, C., Hutter, F., Hoos, H.H., Leyton-Brown, K., Auto-weka: Combined selection and hyperparameter optimization of classification algorithms (2013) KDD; Fitzgerald, B., Software crisis 2.0 (2012) Computer, 45 (4); Feurer, M., Efficient and robust automated machine learning (2015) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems; Maher, M., Sakr, S., Smartml: A meta learning-based framework for automated selection and hyperparameter tuning for machine learning algorithms (2019) EDBT, pp. 554-557; El Shawi, R., Maher, M., Sakr, S., Automated machine learning: State-of-The-Art and open challenges (2019) CoRR, , abs/1906.02287; Kotthoff, L., Thornton, C., Hoos, H.H., Hutter, F., Leyton-Brown, K., Auto-weka 2.0: Automatic model selection and hyperparameter optimization in weka (2017) JMLR, 18 (1); Vanschoren, J., Meta-learning: A survey (2018) CoRR, , abs/1810.03548; Brazdil, P., Giraud Carrier, C., Soares, C., Vilalta, R., (2008) Metalearning: Applications to Data Mining., , Springer Science & Business Media; Giraud-Carrier, C., Metalearning-A tutorial (2008) Tutorial at the 7th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA), , San Diego, California, USA; Bilalli, B., Abelló, A., Aluja-Banet, T., On the predictive power of meta-features in openml (2017) International Journal of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, 27 (4), pp. 697-712; Vanschoren, J., Rijn Van, J.N., Bischl, B., Torgo, L., Openml: Networked science in machine learning (2013) SIGKDD Explorations, 15 (2), pp. 49-60; García, V., On the effectiveness of preprocessing methods when dealing with different levels of class imbalance (2012) Knowledge-Based Systems, 25 (1); Bergstra, J., Bengio, Y., Random search for hyper-parameter optimization (2012) JMLR, 13; Probst, P., Tunability: Importance of hyperparameters of machine learning algorithms (2019) JMLR, 20 (53); Hutter, F., Hoos, H.H., Leyton-Brown, K., Sequential model-based optimization for general algorithm configuration (2011) Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Learning and Intelligent Optimization; Le, T.T., Fu, W., Moore, J.H., (2018) Scaling Tree-based Automated Machine Learning to Biomedical Big Data with A Dataset Selector., , BioRxiv; De Sá, A.G.C., Recipe: A grammar-based framework for automatically evolving classification pipelines (2017) European Conference on Genetic Programming; Mohr, F., Wever, M., Hüllermeier, E., Ml-plan: Automated machine learning via hierarchical planning (2018) Machine Learning; Doan, T., Kalita, J., Predicting run time of classification algorithms using meta-learning (2017) International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics, 8 (6), pp. 1929-1943; Yang, C., Akimoto, Y., Kim, D.W., Udell, M., (2018) Oboe: Collaborative Filtering for Automl Initialization., , arXiv preprint arXiv:1808.03233; Van Rijn, J.N., Hutter, F., Hyperparameter importance across datasets (2018) KDD, KDD '18; Bischl, B., (2017) Openml Benchmarking Suites and the openml100., , arXiv preprint arXiv: 1708.03731; Meng, X., Mllib: Machine learning in apache spark (2016) The Journal of Machine Learning Research, 17 (1), pp. 1235-1241; Boehm, M., Systemml: Declarative machine learning on spark (2016) Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 9 (13), pp. 1425-1436","IEEE Int.

In recent years, there have been successful hyperparameter optimization algorithms. However, these methods still face several challenges, such as high cost of evaluating large models or large datasets. In this paper, we introduce a new deep reinforcement learning architecture with model-based acceleration to optimize hyperparameters for any machine learning model. In this method, an agent constructed by a Long Short-Term Memory Network aims at maximizing the expected accuracy of a machine learning model on a validation set. To speed up training, we employ a model to predict the accuracy on a validation set instead of evaluating a machine learning model. To effectively train the agent and the predictive model, Real-Predictive-Real training process is proposed. Besides, to reduce the variance, we propose a bootstrap pool to guide the exploration in the search space. The experiment was carried out by optimizing hyperparameters of two widely used machine learning models: Random Forests and XGBoost. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms random search, Bayesian optimization, and Tree-structured Parzen Estimator in terms of accuracy, time efficiency and stability. © 2019 IEEE.","Automated machine learning; Deep Reinforcement learning; Hyperparameter optimization","Decision trees; Large dataset; Learning systems; Optimization; Random forests; Reinforcement learning; Automated machines; Bayesian optimization; Hyper-parameter optimizations; Machine learning models; Parzen estimators; Predictive modeling; Short term memory; Time efficiencies; Deep learning","Bergstra, J., Bardenet, R., Bengio, Y., Kégl, B., Algorithms for hyperparameter optimization (2011) Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS11), pp. 2546-2554; Bergstra, J., Bengio, Y., Random search for hyper-parameter optimization (2012) Journal of Machine Learning Research, (13); Breiman, L., Random forests (2001) Machine Learning, 45; Fernández-Delgado, M., Cernadas, E., Barro, S., Amorim, D., Do we need hundreds of classifiers to solve real world classification problems?

Grey and white box modeling requires knowledge about the system and a lot of human assistance, which results in costs. In the common case, that information about the system is lacking, the feasibility of grey and white box models decreases further. The installation of sensors and the availability of monitoring data is growing rapidly within building energy systems. This enables the exploitation of statistical modeling, which is already well established in other sectors like computer science and finance. Thus, the present work investigates data-driven machine learning models to explore their potential for modeling building energy systems. The focus is to develop an efficient methodology for data-driven modeling. For this purpose, a comprehensive literature review for detecting optimization methods is conducted. Furthermore, the methodology is implemented in Python and an automated modeling tool is designed. It is used to model various energy systems based on monitoring data; seven use cases on three different systems reveal good results. The models can be used for forecasting, potential analysis, the implementation of various control strategies or as a replacement for missing information within the field of grey box modeling. © 2019","Automated machine learning; Building automation and control; Building energy modeling; Data-driven modeling; Regression; Time-series forecasting","Automation; Intelligent buildings; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Automated machines; Building automation and controls; Building energy model; Data-driven model; Regression; Time series forecasting; Monitoring","Fumo, N., A review on the basics of building energy estimation (2014) Renewable Sustainable Energy Rev., 31, pp. 53-60; Gorissen, D., Crombecq, K., Couckuyt, I., Dhaene, T., Demeester, P., A surrogate modeling and adaptive sampling toolbox for computer based design (2010) J.

To achieve that, these algorithms learn a mathematical model using sample data. However, there are numerous ML algorithms, all learning different models of reality. Furthermore, the behavior of these algorithms can be altered by modifying some of their plethora of hyperparameters. Cleverly tuning these algorithms is costly but essential to reach decent performance. Yet it requires a lot of expertise and remains hard even for experts who tend to resort to exploration-only approaches like random search and grid search. The field of AutoML has consequently emerged in the quest for automatized machine learning processes that would be less expensive than brute force searches. In this paper we continue the research initiated on the Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT), an AutoML based on Evolutionary Algorithms (EA). EAs are typically slow to converge which makes TPOT incapable of scaling to large datasets. As a consequence, we introduce TPOT-SH inspired from the concept of Successive Halving used in Multi-Armed Bandit problems. This solution allows TPOT to explore the search space faster and have much better performance on larger datasets. © 2019 IEEE.","AutoML; Evolutionary Algorithms; Large Datasets; Successive Halving; TPOT","Evolutionary algorithms; Large dataset; Learning algorithms; Optimization; AutoML; Brute force search; Large datasets; Multi-armed bandit problem; Optimization algorithms; Pipeline optimization; Successive Halving; TPOT; Machine learning","Guyon, I., (2015) Design of the 2015 ChaLearn AutoML Challenge, p. 18; Hutter, F., (2018) Automatic Machine Learning: Methods Systems, Challenges, , Springer; Olson, R.S., Bartley, N., Urbanowicz, R.J., Moore, J.H., Evaluation of a tree-based pipeline optimization tool for automating data science (2016) Proceedings of GECCO 2016, , Mar; Karnin, Z., Koren, T., Somekh, O., Almost optimal exploration in multi-armed bandits (2013) Proceedings of the 30th International Conference on International Conference on Machine Learning, 28, pp. III1238III1246. , Atlanta, GA, USA; Jamieson, K., Talwalkar, A., (2015) Non-stochastic Best Arm Identification and Hyperparameter Optimization, , Feb; Feurer, M., Eggensperger, K., Falkner, S., Lindauer, M., Hutter, F., Practical automated machine learning for the automl challenge 2018 (2018) ICML 2018 AutoML Workshop; Thornton, C., Hutter, F., Hoos, H.H., Leyton-Brown, K., Auto-WEKA: Combined selection and hyperparameter optimization of classification algorithms (2013) Proc. of KDD-2013, p. 847855; Feurer, M., Klein, A., Eggensperger, K., Springenberg, J., Blum, M., Hutter, F., Efficient and robust automated machine learning (2015) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 28, p. 29622970. , C.

One application domain is data science. New techniques in automating the creation of AI, known as AutoAI or AutoML, aim to automate the work practices of data scientists. AutoAI systems are capable of autonomously ingesting and pre-processing data, engineering new features, and creating and scoring models based on a target objectives (e.g. accuracy or run-time efficiency). Though not yet widely adopted, we are interested in understanding how AutoAI will impact the practice of data science. We conducted interviews with 20 data scientists who work at a large, multinational technology company and practice data science in various business settings. Our goal is to understand their current work practices and how these practices might change with AutoAI. Reactions were mixed: while informants expressed concerns about the trend of automating their jobs, they also strongly felt it was inevitable. Despite these concerns, they remained optimistic about their future job security due to a view that the future of data science work will be a collaboration between humans and AI systems, in which both automation and human expertise are indispensable. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Building and selecting the right machine learning models is often a multi-objective optimization problem. General purpose machine learning software that simultaneously supports multiple objectives and constraints is scant, though the potential benefits are great. In this work, we present a framework called Autotune that effectively handles multiple objectives and constraints that arise in machine learning problems. Autotune is built on a suite of derivative-free optimization methods, and utilizes multi-level parallelism in a distributed computing environment for automatically training, scoring, and selecting good models. Incorporation of multiple objectives and constraints in the model exploration and selection process provides the flexibility needed to satisfy trade-offs necessary in practical machine learning applications. Experimental results from standard multi-objective optimization benchmark problems show that Autotune is very efficient in capturing Pareto fronts. These benchmark results also show how adding constraints can guide the search to more promising regions of the solution space, ultimately producing more desirable Pareto fronts. Results from two real-world case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the constrained multi-objective optimization capability offered by Autotune. © 2019 IEEE.","Automated Machine Learning; Distributed Computing System; Multi-objective Optimization","Advanced Analytics; Automation; Constrained optimization; Economic and social effects; Machine learning; Automated machines; Constrained multi-objective optimizations; Derivative-free optimization; Distributed computing environment; Distributed computing systems; Machine learning applications; Machine learning software; Multi-objective optimization problem; Multiobjective optimization","(2018) Cloud AutomlBETA, , https://cloud.google.com/automl; (2018), https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/automl/, Automl; (2018) Open Sourcing Transmogrifai, , https://engineering.salesforce.com/open-sourcing-transmogrifai-4e5d0e098da2; Feurer, M., Klein, A., Eggensperger, K., Springenberg, J., Blum, M., Hutter, F., Efficient and robust automated machine learning (2015) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 28, pp. 2962-2970. , C.

Deep learning discovers the useful features from the input data. This approach simplifies the training of the neural network and makes them faster. The selection of useful patterns from the fruit features results in better accuracy. The number of layers represents the depth of the model. Neural network provides learning to the model. As the dataset contains many features. It is obvious that all features are not relevant to the system. The proposed system learns from these features by identifying the pattern and select the relevant features. This is the most crucial phase of the machine learning to identify the appropriate features to make the system faster and accurate. In this paper, we propose solving fruit surface defect detection using Automated Machine Learning (AML).

With the advancements in the field of computer vision, many researchers have adopted the image processing technique for the microstructure analysis. Most of the previous methods are not adaptable, non-reproducible, semi-automated, and most importantly all these methods are highly influenced by image magnification. Therefore, to overcome these challenges, this paper presents a machine learning based image segmentation method for microstructure analysis and degree of hydration measurement using SEM images. In addition, the authors looked into the impact of magnification of SEM images on the model accuracy and classifier training for the degree of hydration measurement considering two scenarios. First, the image segmentation was performed using a classifier of specific magnification, and then a common classifier is trained using the image of different magnification. The results show that the Random Forest classifier algorithm is suitable for microstructure analysis using SEM images. Through the statistical analysis, it has been proved that there is no significant effect of magnification on model training and accuracy for the degree of hydration measurement. So, a single classifier can be used to process the images of different magnification of a specimen which reduces the effort of training and computational time. The proposed method can generate highly accurate and reliable results in a shorter time and lower cost. Moreover, the findings in this research can be useful for researchers to determine the optimum magnification required for the microstructure analysis. © 2019","Concrete microstructure analysis; Degree of hydration; Image segmentation; Machine learning","Automation; Concretes; Decision trees; Hydration; Image segmentation; Learning systems; Machine learning; Microstructure; Scanning electron microscopy; Classifier training; Degree of hydration; Image magnification; Image processing technique; Microstructure analysis; Random forest classifier; Scanning electron microscopy image; Segmentation methods; Image analysis","Mehta, P.K., Monteiro, P.J., (2017), Concrete Microstructure, Properties and Materials; Roy, D.M., Idorn, G., (1993), Concrete microstructure; Scrivener, K.L., Backscattered electron imaging of cementitious microstructures: understanding and quantification (2004) Cement Concrete Compos., 26 (8), pp. 935-945; Scrivener, K., Snellings, R., Lothenbach, B., A Practical Guide to Microstructural Analysis of Cementitious Materials (2016), CRC Press; Hilal, A.A., Microstructure of Concrete, High Performance Concrete Technology and Applications (2016), InTech; Wong, H., Head, M., Buenfeld, N., Pore segmentation of cement-based materials from backscattered electron images (2006) Cement Concrete Compos., 36 (6), pp. 1083-1090; Wong, H., Buenfeld, N., Determining the water–cement ratio, cement content, water content and degree of hydration of hardened cement paste: Method development and validation on paste samples (2009) Cement Concrete Res., 39 (10), pp. 957-965; Yang, R., Buenfeld, N., Binary segmentation of aggregate in SEM image analysis of concrete (2001) Cement Concrete Res., 31 (3), pp. 437-441; Lee, J.H., Yoo, S.I., An effective image segmentation technique for the SEM image (2008) Industrial Technology, 2008.

Feature selection is one essential method in such applications for multiple objectives: improving the prediction accuracy by eliminating irrelevant features, accelerating the model training and prediction speed, reducing the monitoring and maintenance workload for feature data pipeline, and providing better model interpretation and diagnosis capability. However, selecting an optimal feature subset from a large feature space is considered as an NP-complete problem. The mRMR (Minimum Redundancy and Maximum Relevance) feature selection framework solves this problem by selecting the relevant features while controlling for the redundancy within the selected features. This paper describes the approach to extend, evaluate, and implement the mRMR feature selection methods for classification problem in a marketing machine learning platform at Uber that automates creation and deployment of targeting and personalization models at scale. This study first extends the existing mRMR methods by introducing a non-linear feature redundancy measure and a model-based feature relevance measure. Then an extensive empirical evaluation is performed for eight different feature selection methods, using one synthetic dataset and three real-world marketing datasets at Uber to cover different use cases. Based on the empirical results, the selected mRMR method is implemented in production for the marketing machine learning platform. A description of the production implementation is provided and an online experiment deployed through the platform is discussed. © 2019 IEEE.","Automated machine learning; Classification; Feature selection; Marketing","Advanced Analytics; Classification (of information); Commerce; Computational complexity; E-learning; Machine learning; Marketing; Redundancy; Automated machines; Empirical evaluations; Feature selection methods; Machine learning applications; Maintenance workload; Model interpretations; On-line experiments; Personalization model; Feature extraction","Katsov, I., Introduction to algorithmic marketing: Artificial intelligence for marketing operations (2017) Ilia Katcov; Bolón-Canedo, V., Sánchez-Maroño, N., Alonso-Betanzos, A., A review of feature selection methods on synthetic data (2013) Knowledge and Information Systems, 34 (3), pp. 483-519; Chandrashekar, G., Sahin, F., A survey on feature selection methods (2014) Computers & Electrical Engineering, 40 (1), pp. 16-28; Tang, J., Alelyani, S., Liu, H., Feature selection for classification: A review (2014) Data Classification: Algorithms and Applications, p. 37; Cover, T.M., The best two independent measurements are not the two best (1974) IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, (1), pp. 116-117; Peng, H., Long, F., Ding, C., Feature selection based on mutual information: Criteria of max-dependency, max-relevance, and minredundancy (2005) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis & Machine Intelligence, (8), pp. 1226-1238; Estévez, P.A., Tesmer, M., Perez, C.A., Zurada, J.M., Normalized mutual information feature selection (2009) IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, 20 (2), pp. 189-201; Thang, N.D., Lee, Y.-K., An improved maximum relevance and minimum redundancy feature selection algorithm based on normalized mutual information (2010) 2010 10th IEEE/IPSJ International Symposium on Applications and the Internet.

The experiments carried out by iterative application of these stages give a positive increase in quality for classical machine learning algorithms and a significant increase for deep learning. © 2019 IEEE.","automatic machine learning; deep learning; machine learning; modeling; natural language processing; pre-processing; transfer learning; vectorization","Control systems; Deep learning; Heuristic methods; Iterative methods; Learning systems; Modeling languages; Models; Natural language processing systems; Redundancy; Transfer learning; Automatic machines; Basic solutions; Heuristic approach; Hyperparameters; Intelligence analysis; NAtural language processing; Pre-processing; Vectorization; Learning algorithms","Natural Language Processing, , https://becominghuman.ai/a-simpleintroduction-To-natural-language-processing-ea66a1747b32, date of access: 11.08.19; Sentiment Analysis, , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentimentanalysis, date of access: 11.08.19; Woldemariam, Y., Sentiment analysis in a cross-media analysis framework //2016 (2016) IEEE International Conference on Big Data Analysis (ICBDA, pp. 1-5. , Hangzhou; Ding, J., Sun, H., Wang, X., Liu, X., Entity-Level Sentiment Analysis of Issue Comments (2018) 2018 IEEE/ ACM 3rd International Workshop on Emotion Awareness in Software Engineering (SEmotion, pp. 7-13. , Gothenburg; Ikoro, V., Sharmina, M., Malik, K., Batista-Navarro, R., Analyzing Sentiments Expressed on Twitter by UK Energy Company Consumers //2018 Fifth International Conference on Social Networks Analysis (2018) Management and Security (SNAMS), Valencia, pp. 95-98; Sabra, K.S., Zantout, R.N., Abed, M.A.E., Hamandi, L., (2017) Sentiment Analysis: Arabic Sentiment Lexicons //2017 Sensors Networks Smart and Emerging Technologies (SENSET, pp. 1-4. , Beirut; Vanaja, S., Belwal, M., (2018) Aspect-Level Sentiment Analysis on ECommerce Data //2018 International Conference on Inventive Research in Computing Applications (ICIRCA, pp. 1275-1279. , Coimbatore; Alshari, E.M., Azman, A., Doraisamy, S., Mustapha, N., Alkeshr, M., Effective Method for Sentiment Lexical Dictionary Enrichment Based on Word (2018) 2Vec for Sentiment Analysis //2018 Fourth International Conference on Information Retrieval and Knowledge Management (CAMP, pp. 1-5. , Kota Kinabalu; Large Movie Review Dataset, , http://ai.stanford.edu/amaas/data/sentiment/, date of access: 11.08.19; Amazon Reviews for Sentiment Analysis, , https://www.kaggle.com/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews, date of access: 11.08.19; Twitter US Airline Sentiment, , https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-Airline-sentiment, date of access: 11.08.19; Python, P., https://www.python.org/, date of access: 11.08.19; Scikit-Learn Machine Learning in Python, , https://scikitlearn.org/stable/, date of access: 11.08.19; Scikit-Learn Machine Learning in Python, , https://scikitlearn.org/stable/, date of access: 11.08.19; Gensim Topic Modeling Fro Humans, , https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/, date of access: 11.08.19; Plotly Python Open Source Graphing Library, , https://plot.ly/python/, date of access: 11.08.19; Brown Christopher, D., Davis Herbert, T., Receiver operating characteristic curves and related decision measures: A tutorial (2006) Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems, 80, pp. 24-38; Hochreiter, S., Schmidhuber, J., Long short-Term memory (1997) Neural Computation, 9 (8), pp. 1735-1780; Josef, S., Efficient visual search of videos cast as text retrieval IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 31 (4), pp. 591-605. , IEEE; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf-idf, tf-idf date of access: 11.08.19; Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space, , https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781v3, date of access: 11.08.19; Hyperopt.

Recent AutoML approaches promise to relieve us from this effort. However, they are mainly designed for comparatively small-scale classification tasks. In this work, we show how to use and extend existing AutoML techniques to efficiently optimize large-scale U-Net-like encoder-decoder architectures. In particular, we leverage gradient-based neural architecture search and Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter search. The resulting optimization does not require a large-scale compute cluster. We show results on disparity estimation that clearly outperform the manually optimized baseline and reach state-of-the-art performance. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Network architecture; Bayesian optimization; Classification tasks; Disparity estimations; Encoder-decoder architecture; Hyper-parameter; Neural architectures; Percentage points; State-of-the-art performance; Computer vision","Ahmed, K., Torresani, L., Maskconnect: Connectivity learning by gradient descent (2018) ECCV (5) Volume 11209 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pp. 362-378. , Springer; Amirul Islam, M., Rochan, M., Bruce, B.N.D., Wang, Y., Gated feedback refinement network for dense image labeling (2017) Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR); Badrinarayanan, V., Kendall, A., Cipolla, R., Segnet: A deep convolutional encoder-decoder architecture for image segmentation (2017) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 39 (12), pp. 2481-2495; Baker, B., Gupta, O., Naik, N., Raskar, R., Designing neural network architectures using reinforcement learning (2017) International Conference on Learning Representations; Baker, B., Gupta, O., Raskar, R., Naik, N., Accelerating neural architecture search using performance prediction (2017) International Conference on Learning Representations; Bello, I., Zoph, B., Vasudevan, V., Le, Q.V., Neural optimizer search with reinforcement learning (2017) Proceedings of the 34th International Conference on Machine Learning Volume 70 of Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, pp. 459-468. , Doina Precup and Yee Whye Teh, editors International Convention Centre, Sydney, Australia, 06-11 Aug .

Most existing loss function designs rely on hand-crafted heuristics that require domain experts to explore the large design space, which is usually sub-optimal and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose AutoML for Loss Function Search (AM-LFS) which leverages REINFORCE to search loss functions during the training process. The key contribution of this work is the design of search space which can guarantee the generalization and transferability on different vision tasks by including a bunch of existing prevailing loss functions in a unified formulation. We also propose an efficient optimization framework which can dynamically optimize the parameters of loss function's distribution during training. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark datasets show that, without any tricks, our method outperforms existing hand-crafted loss functions in various computer vision tasks. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Computer vision;

Once a machine learning model is developed, it gets obsolete over time due to presence of new input data being generated every second. In order to keep our predictions accurate we need to find a way to keep our models up to date. Our research work involves finding a mechanism which can retrain the model with new data automatically. This research also involves exploring the possibilities of automating machine learning processes. We started this project by training and testing our model using conventional machine learning methods. The outcome was then compared with the outcome of those experiments conducted using the AutoML methods like TPOT. This helped us in finding an efficient technique to retrain our models. These techniques can be used in areas where people do not deal with the actual working of a ML model but only require the outputs of ML processes. © BEIESP.","AutoML; Data preprocessing; Feature extraction; Feature selection; Hyperparameter; Machine Learning Optimization; Pipeline; Retraining; TPOT",,"Andrew, N.G., CS229 Lecture Notes, , http://cs229.stanford.edu/notes/cs229-notes1.pdf, Stanford; Nastac, D.I., Dan Cristea, P., A Modified Adaptive Retraining Procedure for Data Forecasting (2012) IEEE; Guyon, I., Elisseeff, A., An Introduction to Variable and Feature selection”, , http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/guyon03a/guyon03a.pdf; Nastac, I., (2004) An Adaptive Retraining Technique to Predict the Critical Process Variables, , June 2004; Pham, J., Kyauk, E., Park, E., Predicting Song Popularity, , http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2015/140_report.pdf; Feurer, M., Klein, A., Eggensperger, K., Tobias, J., Manuel Blum, S.-G., Hutter, F., Efficient and Robust Automated Machine Learning (2015) NIPS; Brazdil, P., Giraud-Carrier, C., (2018) Metalearning and Algorithm Selection: Progress, State of the Art and Introduction to the 2018 Special Issue Cross Mark”; Bergstra, J., Yamins, D., Cox, D.D., (2013) Making a Science of Model Search: Hyperparameter Optimization in Hundreds of Dimensions for Vision Architectures”; Kottho, L., Thornton, C., Hoos, H.H., Hutter, F., Leyton-Brown, K., (2017) Auto-WEKA 2, , Automatic model selection and hyperparameter optimization in WEKA”, JMLR; Olson, R.S., Urbanowicz, R.J., (2016) Automating Biomedical Data Science through Tree Based Pipeline Optimization”, , Springer; Olson, R.S., Bartley, N., Urbanowicz, R.J., Moore, J.H., (2016) Evaluation of a Tree-Based Pipeline Optimization Tool for Automating Data Science; Feurer, M., Eggensperger, K., Falkner, S., Lindauer, M., Hutter, F., (2018) Practical Automated Machine Learning for the Automl Challenge; Lu, J., (2017) Machine Learning Modeling for Time Series Problem: Predicting Flight Ticket prices”; Retrain an Azure Machine Learning Studio Model, , https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio/retrain-machine-learning-model; Retraining and Updating Azure Machine Learning Models with Azure Data [Online], , https://azure.microsoft.com/es-es/blog/retraining-and-updating-azure-machine-learning-models-with-azure-data-factory/; Automated Machine Learning; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatedmachinelearning; Automated Machine Learning, , https://www.datarobot.com/wiki/automated-machine-learning, Data Robot; Build, Deploy and Retrain a Predictive Machine Learning [Online], , https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-create-deploy-retrain-machine-learning-model; TPOT Automated Learning in Python, , https://towardsdatascience.com/tpot-automated-machine-learning-in-python-4c063b3e5de9; Keeping Your Machine Learning Models up to Date, , https://medium.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/keeping-your-machine-learning-models-up-to-date-f1ead546591b, using IBM Watson Data Lab; Automated Machine Learning, , https://www.automl.org/automl/, AutoML.org; Machine Learning Definition from Expert System; https://www.expertsystem.com/machine-learning-definition/; Google Crash Course on Machine Learning[Online], , http://www.developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/accuracy; Machine Learning Mastery, Python Step by Step, , https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/; Python Programming, Serializing Using Pickle, , https://www.pythonprogramming.net/python-pickle-module-save-objects-serialization/; Amazon Web Services Documentation[Online], , https://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/when-to-use-machine-learning.html; Data Camp, Feature Selection Python [Online], , https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/feature-selection-python; Data Camp, Exploratory Data Analysis Python 30 Statistics Solution, Mann Whitney U Test, , https://www.statisticssolutions.com/Mann-Whitney-U-Test; Buitinck, L., ECML PKDD Workshop: Languages for Data Mining and Machine Learning 2013, , Scikit Documentation; Gelo, T., Spotify Data Project Part 1-From Data Retrieval to First Insights, , https://tgel0.github.io/blog/spotify-data-project-part-1-from-data-retrieval-to-first-insights/","Int.

While Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has been effectively used to develop low-latency networks for image classification, there has been relatively little effort to use NAS to optimize DNN architectures for other vision tasks. In this work, we present what we believe to be the first proxyless hardware-aware search targeted for dense semantic segmentation. With this approach, we advance the state-of-the-art accuracy for latency-optimized networks on the Cityscapes semantic segmentation dataset. Our latency-optimized small SqueezeNAS network achieves 68.02% validation class mIOU with less than 35 ms inference times on the NVIDIA Xavier. Our latency-optimized large SqueezeNAS network achieves 73.62% class mIOU with less than 100 ms inference times. We demonstrate that significant performance gains are possible by utilizing NAS to find networks optimized for both the specific task and inference hardware. We also present detailed analysis comparing our networks to recent state-of-the-art architectures.

This paper is concerned with assisting nonexpert developers to develop machine learning models. It introduces a modelling assistant tool that guides developers to make design choices in the course of machine learning model development process. The tool presents questions along with candidate answers about what to do at each phase and asks the developer to make choice of a candidate with additional associated information editing. For intelligent assistance, we have integrated and organized the knowledge for machine learning model development into the tool.

Although powerful, such systems require manual configuration and tuning. To this end, we view CNNs as configurable systems and propose an end-to-end framework that allows the configuration, evaluation and automated search for CNN architectures. Therefore, our contribution is threefold. First, we model the variability of CNN architectures with a Feature Model (FM) that generalizes over existing architectures. Each valid configuration of the FM corresponds to a valid CNN model that can be built and trained. Second, we implement, on top of Tensorflow, an automated procedure to deploy, train and evaluate the performance of a configured model. Third, we propose a method to search for configurations and demonstrate that it leads to good CNN models. We evaluate our method by applying it on image classification tasks (MNIST, CIFAR-10) and show that, with limited amount of computation and training, our method can identify high-performing architectures (with high accuracy). We also demonstrate that we outperform existing state-of-the-art architectures handcrafted by ML researchers. Our FM and framework have been released to support replication and future research. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","AutoML; Configuration search; Feature model; NAS; Neural architecture search","Automation; Computer software; Convolution; Frequency modulation; Neural networks; Sodium; Automated procedures; AutoML; Configurable systems; Configuration search; Convolutional neural network; Existing architectures; Feature modeling; Neural architectures; Network architecture","Baker, B., Gupta, O., Naik, N., Raskar, R., Designing neural network architectures using reinforcement learning (2017) CoRR, , 2017; Benavides, D., Segura, S., Ruiz-Cortés, A., Automated analysis of feature models 20 years later: A literature review (2010) Inf.

Significant time and expertise are needed to customize the model for a specific problem. A significant way to reduce the complicated design is by using Automated Machine Learning (AML) that can intelligently optimize the best pipeline suitable for a problem or dataset. This paper demonstrates the utilization of an AML that has been developed with a meta-heuristic algorithm namely Genetic Programming (GP). Empirical experiment has been conducted to test the performances of AML on a real dataset of house prices in the area of Petaling Jaya, Selangor. The results show that the AML with GP able to produce the best pipeline of machine learning with high score of accuracy and minimal error.

From the varieties of the machine learning algorithms, selecting the best model with the best configurations is a critical and complex design issue. In light of this situation, automated machine learning pipeline is highly beneficial. Research has proved that Genetic Programming is highly useful to find the best pipeline of an automated machine learning model. However, in respond to the implementation difficulty, there exists a limited software tool that support easy implementation for automated machine learning based on Genetic Programming. This paper presents the specifications of a domain specific scripting language for the easy development of an automated machine learning with the underlying Genetic Programming.

However, designing a high-performance neural architecture requires substantial efforts and expertise. In this paper, we make the first attempt to let algorithm automatically design neural networks for video action recognition tasks. Specifically, a spatio-temporal network is developed in a differentiable space modeled by a directed acyclic graph, thus a gradient-based strategy can be performed to search an optimal architecture. Nonetheless, it is computationally expensive, since the computational burden to evaluate each architecture candidate is still heavy. To alleviate this issue, we, for the video input, introduce a temporal segment approach to reduce the computational cost without losing global video information. For the architecture, we explore in an efficient search space by introducing pseudo 3D operators. Experiments show that, our architecture outperforms popular neural architectures, under the training from scratch protocol, on the challenging UCF101 dataset, surprisingly, with only around one percentage of parameters of its manual-design counterparts. © 2019 IEEE.","Automated machine learning; neural architecture search; video action recognition",,"Le, Q., Zou, W., Yeung, S., Ng, A., Learning hierarchical invariant spatio-temporal features for action recognition with independent subspace analysis (2011) Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2011 IEEE Conference on.

Model searches, which explore to find an optimal ML algorithm and hyperparameter values for the target problem, play a critical role in such improvements. During a model search, data scientists typically use multiple ML implementations to construct several predictive models; however, it takes significant time and effort to employ multiple ML implementations due to the need to learn how to use them, prepare input data in several different formats, and compare their outputs. Our proposed framework addresses these issues by providing simple and unified coding method. It has been designed with the following two attractive features: i) new machine learning implementations can be added easily via common interfaces between the framework and ML implementations and ii) it can be scaled to handle large model configuration search spaces via profile-based scheduling. The results of our evaluation indicate that, with our framework, implementers need only write 55-144 lines of code to add a new ML implementation. They also show that ours was the fastest framework for the HIGGS dataset, and the second-fastest for the SECOM dataset. © 2019 IEEE.","Automated machine learning; Parallel computing; Parameter search; Scheduling",,"Parra, J., Kiekintveld, C., Initial exploration of machine learning to predict customer demand in an energy market simulation (2013) AI Access Foundation, 1, pp. 29-32. , WS-13-15; Ince, H., Trafalis, T.B., Kernel principal component analysis and support vector machines for stock price prediction (2007) IIE Transactions, 39 (6), pp. 629-637; McMahan, H.B., Holt, G., Sculley, D., Young, M., Ebner, D., Grady, J., Nie, L., Kubica, J., Ad click prediction: A view from the trenches (2013) Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 1222-1230. , http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2487575.2488200, ser.

Methods: 62 patients who received a DCE-MRI breast scan were enrolled. Tumor resection and sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy were performed within 1 week after the DCE-MRI examination. According to the time signal intensity curve, the volumes of interest (VOIs) were delineated on the whole tumor in the images with the strongest enhanced phase. Datasets were randomly divided into two sets including a training set (∼80%) and a validation set (∼20%). A total of 1,409 quantitative imaging features were extracted from each VOI. The select K best and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) were used to obtain the optimal features. Three classification models based on the logistic regression (LR), XGboost, and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were constructed. Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) analysis was used to analyze the prediction performance of the models. Both feature selection and models construction were firstly performed in the training set, then were further tested in the validation set by the same thresholds. Results: There is no significant difference between all clinical and pathological variables in breast cancer patients with and without SLN metastasis (P > 0.05), except histological grade (P = 0.03). Six features were obtained as optimal features for models construction. In the validation set, with respect to the accuracy and MSE, the SVM demonstrated the highest performance, with an accuracy, AUC, sensitivity (for positive SLN), specificity (for positive SLN) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.85, 0.83, 0.71, 1, 0.26, respectively. Conclusions: We demonstrated the feasibility of combining artificial intelligence and radiomics from DCE-MRI of primary tumors to predict axillary SLN metastasis in breast cancer. This non-invasive approach could be very promising in application. © 2019 Liu, Sun, Chen, Fang, Song, Guo, Ni, Liu, Feng, Xia, Zhang and Li.","Automatic machine learning; Breast cancer; DCE-MRI; Radiomics;

Data scientists need to evaluate various learning algorithms and tune their numerous parameters, based on their assumptions and experience, against concrete problems and training data sets. This is a long, tedious, and resource expensive task. Meta-learning is a recent technique to overcome, i.e. automate this problem. It aims at using machine learning itself to automatically learn the most appropriate algorithms and parameters for a machine learning problem. As it turns out, there are many parallels between meta-modelling - in the sense of model-driven engineering - and meta-learning. Both rely on abstractions, the meta data, to model a predefined class of problems and to define the variabilities of the models conforming to this definition. Both are used to define the output and input relationships and then fitting the right models to represent that behaviour. In this paper, we envision how a meta-model for meta-learning can look like. We discuss possible variabilities, for what types of learning it could be appropriate for, how concrete learning models can be generated from it, and how models can be finally selected. Last but not least, we discuss a possible integration into existing modelling tools. © 2019 IEEE.","AutoML; meta-learning; meta-modelling; modelling framework","Concretes; Machine learning; Parameter estimation; AutoML; Machine learning problem; Meta-modelling; Metalearning; Model-driven Engineering; Modelling framework; Real-life problems; Training data sets; Learning algorithms","(2018) European Data Protection Supervisor, the EU's Independent Data Protection Authority, Giovanni Buttarelli, What Do We Learn from Machine Learning?, , https://edps.europa.eu/press-publications/press-news/blog/what-dowe-learn-machine-learningen, [Online], [Accessed: 25-Feb-2019]; Chen, C., Seff, A., Kornhauser, A., Xiao, J., Deepdriving: Learning affordance for direct perception in autonomous driving (2015) Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pp. 2722-2730. , ser.

Although it is difficult to justify the daily use of MRI in the cases of the people recently diagnosed with cancer, the advantage of breast MRI has to be dominant over the biopsies suggested on the basis of findings from MRI. Now, the challenge lies in identifying those patients for whom, breast MRI is carried out and further causes effect on preoperative planning and thus causes a serious effect on the medical outcomes. Gene expression profiling has actually identified a number of unique subtypes of molecules for breast cancer that keeps on varying in the prognosis. There are five important molecular subtypes of breast cancer which are based on the genes that are expressed by cancer-causing tissues such as Luminal-A, Luminal-B, Triple negative basal-like, HER2 enriched, and Nominal. Once the appropriate subtype has been predicted it will help in treating cancer. Thus, the prediction of an accurate molecular subtype of breast cancer plays an important role. Through our study, we found that usage of Automated Machine Learning comes out to be the most efficient way in predicting the molecular subtypes even without increasing our dataset. We implemented BOHB (Bayesian Optimization Hyperband) which helps in optimizing the values of hyperparameters including learning rate, activation function, and optimizer.. © 2019 Galgotias University.","AutoML; BOHB; Breast Cancer; Deep Learning; Molecular Subtype","Diagnosis; Gene expression; Activation functions; Automated machines; Bayesian optimization; Gene expression profiling; Hyperparameters; Learning rates; Pre-operative planning; Triple negative; Diseases","Ghoncheh, M., Momenimovahed, Z., Epidemiology, S.H., Incidence and mortality of breast cancer in Asia (2016) Asian Pac J Cancer Prev., 17, pp. 47-52; Ghoncheh, M., Pournamdar, Z., Salehiniya, H., Incidence and mortality and epidemiology of breast cancer in the world (2016) Asian Pac J Cancer Prev., 17, pp. 43-46. , Spec No; Global Cancer Observatory, , www.gco.iarc.fr; Goldhirsch, A., Winer, E.P., Coates, A.S., Gelber, R.D., Piccart-Gebhart, M., Thürlimann, B., Senn, H.J., Panel members-Personalizing the treatment of women with early breast cancer: Highlights of the St Gallen (2013) International Expert Consensus on the Primary Therapy of Early Breast Cancer 2013.

In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNN) generate a keen interest among researchers in computer vision and more specifically in classification tasks. CNN architecture and related hyperparameters are generally correlated to the nature of the processed task as the network extracts complex and relevant characteristics allowing the optimal convergence. Designing such architectures requires significant human expertise, substantial computation time and does not always lead to the optimal network. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been extensively used in automating CNN models design generating notable advances and interesting results in the field.

Capturing interindividual variability is essential to increase the statistical power necessary for building more accurate predictive models. However, available approaches have difficulty coping with incomplete datasets which is often the case when combining studies. Additionally, there are hundreds of algorithms available and no simple way to find the optimal one. In this study, we developed Sequential Iterative Modeling “OverNight” (SIMON), an automated machine learning system that compares results from 128 different algorithms and is particularly suitable for datasets containing many missing values. We applied SIMON to data from five clinical studies of seasonal influenza vaccination. The results reveal previously unrecognized CD4+and CD8+T cell subsets strongly associated with a robust Ab response to influenza Ags. These results demonstrate that SIMON can greatly speed up the choice of analysis modalities. Hence, it is a highly useful approach for data-driven hypothesis generation from disparate clinical datasets. Our strategy could be used to gain biological insight from ever-expanding heterogeneous datasets that are publicly available. The Journal of Immunology, 2019, 203: 749–759.

Network morphism, which keeps the functionality of a neural network while changing its neural architecture, could be helpful for NAS by enabling more efficient training during the search. In this paper, we propose a novel framework enabling Bayesian optimization to guide the network morphism for efficient neural architecture search. The framework develops a neural network kernel and a tree-structured acquisition function optimization algorithm to efficiently explores the search space. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets have been done to demonstrate the superior performance of the developed framework over the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we build an open-source AutoML system based on our method, namely Auto-Keras. The code and documentation are available at https://autokeras.com. The system runs in parallel on CPU and GPU, with an adaptive search strategy for different GPU memory limits. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Automated Machine Learning; AutoML; Bayesian Optimization; Network Morphism; Neural Architecture Search","Benchmarking; Data mining; Deep neural networks; Open systems; Trees (mathematics); Automated machines; AutoML; Bayesian optimization; Morphisms; Neural architectures; Network architecture","Auer, P., Cesa-Bianchi, N., Fischer, P., Finite-time analysis of the multiarmed bandit problem (2002) Machine Learning, , 2002; Baker, B., Gupta, O., Naik, N., Raskar, R., (2016) Designing Neural Network Architectures Using Reinforcement Learning, , preprint 2016; Bergstra, J., Yamins, D., Cox, D.D., Hyperopt: A python library for optimizing the hyperparameters of machine learning algorithms (2013) Python in Science Conference; Bourgain, J., On Lipschitz embedding of finite metric spaces in Hilbert space (1985) Israel Journal of Mathematics, , 1985; Brock, A., Lim, T., Ritchie, J.M., Weston, N., (2017) SMASH: One-Shot Model Architecture Search through Hypernetworks, , preprint 2017; Buitinck, L., Louppe, G., Blondel, M., Pedregosa, F., Mueller, A., Grisel, O., Niculae, V., Grobler, J., API design for machine learning software: Experiences from the scikit-learn project (2013) ECML PKDD Workshop: Languages for Data Mining and Machine Learning; Cai, H., Chen, T., Zhang, W., Yu, Y., Wang, J., Efficient architecture search by network transformation (2018) AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence; Cai, H., Zhu, L., Han, S., Proxylessnas: Direct neural architecture search on target task and hardware (2019) International Conference on Learning Representations; Chai, Q., Gong, G., Verifiable symmetric searchable encryption for semi-honest-but-curious cloud servers (2012) International Conference on Communications; Chen, T., Goodfellow, I., Shlens, J., (2015) Net2net: Accelerating Learning Via Knowledge Transfer, , preprint 2015; Chollet, F., (2015) Keras, , https://keras.io; Desell, T., Large scale evolution of convolutional neural networks using volunteer computing (2017) Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference Companion; Elsken, T., Metzen, J.-H., Hutter, F., (2017) Simple and Efficient Architecture Search for Convolutional Neural Networks, , preprint 2017; Elsken, T., Metzen, J.H., Hutter, F., (2018) Neural Architecture Search: A Survey, , preprint 2018; Feurer, M., Klein, A., Eggensperger, K., Springenberg, J., Blum, M., Hutter, F., Efficient and robust automated machine learning (2015) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems; Ghiasi, G., Lin, T.-Y., Pang, R., Le, Q.V., (2019) NAS-FPN: Learning Scalable Feature Pyramid Architecture for Object Detection, , preprint 2019; Guo, Z., Zhang, X., Mu, H., Heng, W., Liu, Z., Wei, Y., Sun, J., (2019) Single Path One-Shot Neural Architecture Search with Uniform Sampling, , preprint 2019; Haasdonk, B., Bahlmann, C., Learning with distance substitution kernels (2004) Joint Pattern Recognition Symposium; Hart, P.E., Nilsson, N.J., Raphael, B., A formal basis for the heuristic determination of minimum cost paths (1968) IEEE Transactions on Systems Science and Cybernetics, , 1968; Huang, X., Song, Q., Yang, F., Hu, X., Large-scale heterogeneous feature embedding (2019) AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence; Hutter, F., Hoos, H.H., Leyton-Brown, K., Sequential model-based optimization for general algorithm configuration (2011) International Conference on Learning and Intelligent Optimization; Kandasamy, K., Neiswanger, W., Schneider, J., Poczos, B., Xing, E., Neural architecture search with Bayesian optimisation and optimal transport (2018) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, , 2018; Kirkpatrick, S., Daniel Gelatt, C., Vecchi, M.P., (1983) Optimization by Simulated Annealing, , science 1983; Kotthoff, L., Thornton, C., Hoos, H.H., Hutter, F., Leyton-Brown, K., Auto-Weka 2.0: Automatic model selection and hyperparameter optimization in WEKA (2016) Journal of Machine Learning Research, , 2016; Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., (2009) Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images, , Technical Report.

Despite their widespread success, NE algorithms typically contain a large number of hyperparameters for preserving the various network properties, which must be carefully tuned in order to achieve satisfactory performance. Though automated machine learning (AutoML) has achieved promising results when applied to many types of data such as images and texts, network data poses great challenges to AutoML and remains largely ignored by the literature of AutoML. The biggest obstacle is the massive scale of real-world networks, along with the coupled node relationships that make any straightforward sampling strategy problematic. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, named AutoNE, to automatically optimize the hyperparameters of a NE algorithm on massive networks. In detail, we employ a multi-start random walk strategy to sample several small sub-networks, perform each trial of configuration selection on the sampled sub-network, and design a meta-leaner to transfer the knowledge about optimal hyperparameters from the sub-networks to the original massive network. The transferred meta-knowledge greatly reduces the number of trials required when predicting the optimal hyperparameters for the original network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can significantly outperform the existing methods, in that it needs less time and fewer trials to find the optimal hyperparameters. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Automated Machine Learning; Hyperparameter Optimization; Machine Learning on Graphs; Meta-Learning; Network Embedding; Network Representation Learning","Embeddings; Large scale systems; Machine learning; Vector spaces; Automated machines; Hyper-parameter optimizations; Metalearning; Network embedding; Network representation; Data mining","Auer, P., (2002) Using Confidence Bounds for Exploitation-Exploration Tradeoffs, , 2002; Bergstra, J., Bengio, Y., Random search for hyper-parameter optimization (2012) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 13, pp. 281-305. , Feb (2012; Cao, S., Lu, W., Xu, Q., Grarep: Learning graph representations with global structural information (2015) Proceedings of the 24th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, , ACM; Chung, F.R.K., Graham, F.C., (1997) Spectral Graph Theory, , Number 92.

Automated machine learning (AutoML) seeks to automate these tasks to enable widespread use of machine learning by non-experts. This paper introduces Oboe, a collaborative filtering method for time-constrained model selection and hyperparameter tuning. Oboe forms a matrix of the cross-validated errors of a large number of supervised learning models (algorithms together with hyperparameters) on a large number of datasets, and fits a low rank model to learn the low-dimensional feature vectors for the models and datasets that best predict the cross-validated errors. To find promising models for a new dataset, Oboe runs a set of fast but informative algorithms on the new dataset and uses their cross-validated errors to infer the feature vector for the new dataset. Oboe can find good models under constraints on the number of models fit or the total time budget. To this end, this paper develops a new heuristic for active learning in time-constrained matrix completion based on optimal experiment design. Our experiments demonstrate that Oboe delivers state-of-the-art performance faster than competing approaches on a test bed of supervised learning problems. Moreover, the success of the bilinear model used by Oboe suggests that AutoML may be simpler than was previously understood. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","AutoML; Collaborative filtering; Meta-learning; Model selection; Time-constrained","Budget control; Collaborative filtering; Data mining; Errors; Large dataset; Learning algorithms; Matrix algebra; Supervised learning; AutoML; Collaborative filtering methods; Metalearning; Model Selection; Optimal experiment design; State-of-the-art performance; Supervised learning problems; Time-constrained; Machine learning","Bardenet, R., Brendel, M., Kégl, B., Sebag, M., Collaborative hyperparameter tuning (2013) ICML, pp. 199-207; Bartz-Beielstein, T., Markon, S., Tuning search algorithms for real-world applications: A regression tree based approach (2004) Congress on Evolutionary Computation, 1, pp. 1111-1118; Bergstra, J.S., Bardenet, R., Bengio, Y., Kégl, B., Algorithms for hyper-parameter optimization (2011) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 2546-2554; Bischl, B., Richter, J., Bossek, J., Horn, D., Thomas, J., Lang, M., (2017) mlrMBO: A Modular Framework for Model-Based Optimization of Expensive Black-Box Functions, , preprint 2017; Boyd, S., Vandenberghe, L., (2004) Convex Optimization, , Cambridge University Press; Caruana, R., Munson, A., Niculescu-Mizil, A., Getting the most out of ensemble selection (2006) ICDM, pp. 828-833; Caruana, R., Niculescu-Mizil, A., Crew, G., Ksikes, A., Ensemble selection from libraries of models (2004) ICML, p. 18; Chen, B., Wu, H., Mo, W., Chattopadhyay, I., Lipson, H., Autostacker: A compositional evolutionary learning system (2018) Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference, pp. 402-409; Cunha, T., Soares, C., De Carvalho, A.C.P.L.F., CF4CF: Recommending collaborative filtering algorithms using collaborative filtering (2018) Proceedings of the 12th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys'18), pp. 357-361. , https://doi.org/10.1145/3240323.3240378, ACM, New York, NY, USA; Dheeru, D., Taniskidou, E.K., (2017) UCI Machine Learning Repository, , http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml; Drori, I., Krishnamurthy, Y., Rampin, R., De Paula Lourenco, R., Ono, J.P., Cho, K., Silva, C., Freire, J., Alphad3M: Machine learning pipeline synthesis (2018) AutoML Workshop at ICML; Feurer, M., Klein, A., Eggensperger, K., Springenberg, J., Blum, M., Hutter, F., Efficient and robust automated machine learning (2015) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 2962-2970; Feurer, M., Springenberg, J.T., Hutter, F., Using meta-learning to initialize Bayesian optimization of hyperparameters (2014) International Conference on Meta-Learning and Algorithm Selection, pp. 3-10. , Citeseer; Fusi, N., Sheth, R., Elibol, M., Probabilistic matrix factorization for automated machine learning (2018) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 3352-3361; Golub, G.H., Van Loan, C.F., (2012) Matrix Computations, , JHU Press; Hazan, E., Klivans, A., Yuan, Y., Hyperparameter optimization: A spectral approach (2018) ICLR, , https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1zriGeCZ; Herbrich, R., Lawrence, N.D., Seeger, M., Fast sparse Gaussian process methods: The informative vector machine (2003) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 625-632; Huang, L., Jia, J., Yu, B., Chun, B.-G., Maniatis, P., Naik, M., Predicting execution time of computer programs using sparse polynomial regression (2010) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 883-891; Hutter, F., Hamadi, Y., Hoos, H.H., Leyton-Brown, K., Performance prediction and automated tuning of randomized and parametric algorithms (2006) International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming, pp. 213-228. , Springer; Hutter, F., Hoos, H.H., Leyton-Brown, K., Sequential model-based optimization for general algorithm configuration (2011) LION, 5, pp. 507-523. , 2011; Hutter, F., Xu, L., Hoos, H.H., Leyton-Brown, K., Algorithm runtime prediction: Methods & evaluation (2014) Artificial Intelligence, 206, pp. 79-111. , 2014; St John, R.C., Draper, N.R., D-optimality for regression designs: A review (1975) Technometrics, 17 (1), pp. 15-23. , 1975; Kim, J., Park, H., (2008) Sparse Nonnegative Matrix Factorization for Clustering, , Technical Report.

In this paper, we present AutoCross, an automatic feature crossing tool provided by 4Paradigm to its customers, ranging from banks, hospitals, to Internet corporations. By performing beam search in a tree-structured space, AutoCross enables efficient generation of high-order cross features, which is not yet visited by existing works. Additionally, we propose successive mini-batch gradient descent and multi-granularity discretization to further improve efficiency and effectiveness, while ensuring simplicity so that no machine learning expertise or tedious hyper-parameter tuning is required. Furthermore, the algorithms are designed to reduce the computational, transmitting, and storage costs involved in distributed computing. Experimental results on both benchmark and real-world business datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of AutoCross. It is shown that AutoCross can significantly enhance the performance of both linear and deep models.1 © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","AutoML; Feature Crossing; Tabular Data","Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Efficiency; Gradient methods; AutoML; Categorical features; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Enhance learning; Gradient descent; Multi-granularity; Tabular data; Tree-structured; Data mining","Agrawal, R., Imielinski, T., Swami, A., Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases (1993) ACM Sigmod Record, 22, pp. 207-216; Blondel, M., Fujino, A., Ueda, N., Ishihata, M., Higher-order factorization machines (2016) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 3351-3359; Bobadilla, J., Ortega, F., Hernando, A., Gutiérrez, A., Recommender systems survey (2013) Knowledge-Based Systems, 46, pp. 109-132. , 2013; Bolton, R., Hand, D., Statistical fraud detection: A review (2002) Statistical Science, pp. 235-249. , 2002; Chapelle, O., Manavoglu, E., Rosales, R., Simple and scalable response prediction for display advertising (2015) ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST), 5 (4), p. 61. , 2015; Cheng, C., Xia, F., Zhang, T., King, I., Lyu, M., Gradient boosting factorization machines (2014) ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, pp. 265-272; Cheng, H.-T., Koc, L., Harmsen, J., Shaked, T., Chandra, T., Aradhye, H., Anderson, G., Ispir, M., Wide & deep learning for recommender systems (2016) Workshop on Deep Learning for Recommender Systems, pp. 7-10; Crankshaw, D., Wang, X., Zhou, G., Franklin, M., Gonzalez, J., Stoica, I., Clipper: A low-latency online prediction serving system (2017) USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation, pp. 613-627; Domingos, P., A few useful things to know about machine learning (2012) Commun.

However, until now, not much attention has been given to them in the Auto-ML field. In this sense, this work presents Auto-CVE (Automated Coevolutionary Voting Ensemble) a new approach to Auto-ML. Based on a coevolutionary model, it uses two populations (one of ensembles and another for components) to actively search for voting ensembles. When compared to the popular algorithm TPOT, Auto-CVE shows competitive results in both accuracy and computing time. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Auto-ML; Coevolution; Ensemble Methods; Supervised Learning","Automation; Supervised learning; Auto-ML; Automated machines; Co-evolution; Co-evolutionary; Co-evolutionary approach; Coevolutionary models; Computing time; Ensemble methods; Machine learning","Augusto, D.A., Barbosa, H.J.C., Ebecken, N.F.F., Coevolutionary multi-population genetic programming for data classification (2010) Proc.

However, the success of DNNs depends on the proper configuration of its architecture and hyperparameters. Such a configuration is difficult and as a result, DNNs are often not used to their full potential. In addition, DNNs in commercial applications often need to satisfy real-world design constraints such as size or number of parameters. To make configuration easier, automatic machine learning (AutoML) systems for deep learning have been developed, focusing mostly on optimization of hyperparameters. This paper takes AutoML a step further. It introduces an evolutionary AutoML framework called LEAF that not only optimizes hyperparameters but also network architectures and the size of the network. LEAF makes use of both state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and distributed computing frameworks. Experimental results on medical image classification and natural language analysis show that the framework can be used to achieve state-of-the-art performance. In particular, LEAF demonstrates that architecture optimization provides a significant boost over hyperparameter optimization, and that networks can be minimized at the same time with little drop in performance. LEAF therefore forms a foundation for democratizing and improving AI, as well as making AI practical in future applications. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Since domain experts often have little or no expertise in machine learning, easy-to-use interactive interfaces that guide them throughout the model building process are necessary. In this paper, we present Visus, a system designed to support the model building process and curation of ML data processing pipelines generated by AutoML systems.

This paper focuses on auto-sklearn, which is a recently-developed software library for automated machine learning, that can automatically select appropriate prediction models, hyperparameters and data preprocessing techniques for a given data set and develop their ensemble with optimized weights. In this paper we empirically evaluate the effectiveness of auto-sklearn in predicting the number of defects in software modules. In the experiment, we used software metrics of 20 OSS projects for cross-release defect prediction and compared auto-sklearn with random forest, decision tree and linear discriminant analysis by using Norm(Popt) as a performance measure. As a result, auto-sklearn showed similar prediction performance as random forest, which is one of the best prediction models for defect prediction in past studies. This indicates that auto-sklearn can obtain good prediction performance for defect prediction without any knowledge of machine learning techniques and models. © 2019 IEEE.","auto-sklearn; cross-release prediction; defect prediction; meta-learning; software quality","Computer software selection and evaluation; Decision trees; Defects; Discriminant analysis; Machine learning; auto-sklearn; Data preprocessing technique; Defect prediction; Linear discriminant analysis; Machine learning techniques; Metalearning; Parameter optimization; Software Quality; Forecasting","Monden, A., Hayashi, T., Shinoda, S., Shirai, K., Yoshida, J., Barker, M., Matsumoto, K., Assessing the cost effectiveness of fault prediction in ac-ceptance testing (2013) IEEE Trans.

Thus, there is a growing demand for professionals in this area, which has favored the entry of countless inexperienced users in the labor market. The path from the initial step to the use of algorithms and Machine Learning techniques in production environment takes considerable time, even from experts, due to the realization of interactive and manual tasks required for building predictive models that provide the desired results. In view of this, this work presents a tool to automate the construction, evaluation and selection of predictive models considering Machine Learning algorithms and parameters values more appropriate for each situation. The stages of feature selection, standardization, resampling, and training in the construction of models were considered in the tool. The proposed tool deal with the treatment of the problem of data unbalancing, as needed, as well as the execution control of the steps involved in the process of creating predictive models. The results obtained demonstrate that the order and choice of the steps and the values chosen for the algorithm parameters affect the final results of the generated models. © 2003-2012 IEEE.","Automated Machine Learning; Automatic Algorithm Selection; Machine Learning; Model Selection","Genetic algorithms; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Parameter estimation; Automated machines; Automatic algorithms; Construction of models; Diverse applications; Machine learning models; Machine learning techniques; Model Selection; Production environments; Machine learning","Bose, I., Mahapatra, R.K., Business data mining-a machine learning perspective (2001) Information & Management, 39 (3), pp. 211-225; Witten, I.H., Frank, E., Hall, M.A., Pal, C.J., (2016) Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques, , Morgan Kaufmann; Sparks, E.R., Talwalkar, A., Haas, D., Franklin, M.J., Jordan, M.I., Kraska, T., Automating Model Search for Large Scale Machine Learning (2015) Proceedings of the Sixth ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing.

In order to ensure the construction of a robust trained model (under practical constraints) to address TSC, we propose DyReg-FResNet, which is a dynamically regularized Residual Network (ResNet), amplified by unsupervised feature space training. We generate signal processing, information theoretic and statistical features to augment the representation learning of the ResNet. The unsupervised features are capable of extracting the morphological and structural characteristics of the time series signals, whereas our proposed dynamic regularizer trades off by reducing substantial variance while not perturbing the bias. The regularization factor is a function of the signal dynamics (in effect, regularization factor is different for different training sets). DyReg-FResNet learns through residual mapping to minimize the exploding or vanishing gradient problems, amplified unsupervised features amplify the representation space by introducing lower level representation to guide the learning towards the basins of attraction of minima and dynamic regularizer minimizes the generalization error. We extensively experiment with publicly available UCR time series datasets. DyReg-FResNet demonstrates extremely superior performance by consistently outperforming the existing benchmark results as well as current state-of-the-art algorithms. © 2019 IEEE.","Automated Machine Learning; feature representation; Regularization; ResNet; Time Series Classification","Benchmarking; Signal processing; Automated machines; Feature representation; Regularization; ResNet; Time series classifications; Time series","Geurts, P., Pattern extraction for time series classification (2001) European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, pp. 115-127; Esling, P., Agon, C., Time-series data mining (2012) ACM Computing Surveys, 45 (1); Bagnall, A., Lines, J., Bostrom, A., Large, J., Keogh, E., The great time series classification bake off: A review and experimental evaluation of recent algorithmic advances (2017) Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, pp. 606-660; Keogh, E., Ratanamahatana, C.A., Exact indexing of dynamic time warping (2005) Knowledge and Information Systems, 7 (3), pp. 358-386; Zhiguang, W., Weizhong, Y., Oates, T., Time series classification from scratch with deep neural networks: A strong baseline (2017) International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN); Bagnall, A., Lines, J., Hills, J., Bostrom, A., Time-series classification with COTE: The collective of transformation-based ensembles (2016) International Conference on Data Engineering, pp. 1548-1549; Bagnall, A., Lines, J., Vickers, W., Keogh, E., The UEA & UCR Time Series Classification Repository, , www.timeseriesclassification.com; Chen, Y., (2015) The UCR Time Series Classification Archive, , www.cs.ucr.edu/-eamonn/time_series_data; Schafer, P., The boss is concerned with time series classification in the presence of noise (2015) Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 29 (6), pp. 1505-1530; Lucas, B., (2018) Proximity Forest: An Effective and Scalable Distancebased Classifier for Time Series, , https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.10594, ArXiv; Fawaz, H.I., Forestier, G., Weber, J., Idoumghar, L., Muller, P.A., (2018) Deep Learning for Time Series Classification: A Review, , https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04356, ArXiv; He, K., Zhang, X., Ren, S., Sun, J., Deep residual learning for image recognition (2016) IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 770-778; Erhan, D., Bengio, Y., Courville, A., Manzagol, P., Vincent, P., Bengio, S., Why does unsupervised pre-training help deep learning?

Building such models from data often involves the application of some form of machine learning. Thus, there is an ever growing demand in work force with the necessary skill set to do so. This demand has given rise to a new research topic concerned with fitting machine learning models fully automatically - AutoML. This paper gives an overview of the state of the art in AutoML with a focus on practical applicability in a business context, and provides recent benchmark results of the most important AutoML algorithms. © 2019 IEEE.","Automated Machine Learning;

At present, this requires experts and training human coding teams, which is slow, expensive, and labor intensive. Machine learning and speech signal processing technologies provide a way to scale up feedback in psychotherapy. We evaluated an initial proof of concept automated feedback system that generates motivational interviewing quality metrics and provides easy access to other session data (e.g., transcripts). The system automatically provides a report of session-level metrics (e.g., therapist empathy) and therapist behavior codes at the talk-turn level (e.g., reflections). We assessed usability, therapist satisfaction, perceived accuracy, and intentions to adopt. A sample of 21 novice (n = 10) or experienced (n = 11) therapists each completed a 10-min session with a standardized patient. The system received the audio from the session as input and then automatically generated feedback that therapists accessed via a web portal. All participants found the system easy to use and were satisfied with their feedback, 83% found the feedback consistent with their own perceptions of their clinical performance, and 90% reported they were likely to use the feedback in their practice. We discuss the implications of applying new technologies to evaluation of psychotherapy. © 2019 American Psychological Association.","Adherence; Dissemination; Feedback; Machine learning; Motivational interviewing","adult; article; clinical article; controlled study; empathy; feasibility study; feedback system; female; genetic transcription; human; machine learning; male; motivational interviewing; perception; proof of concept; psychotherapy; satisfaction; clinical competence; feasibility study; mental disease; motivational interviewing; procedures; psychological feedback; psychology; Adult; Clinical Competence; Feasibility Studies; Feedback, Psychological; Female; Humans; Machine Learning; Male; Mental Disorders; Motivational Interviewing","Atkins, D.C., Steyvers, M., Imel, Z.E., Smyth, P., Scaling up the evaluation of psychotherapy: Evaluating motivational interviewing fidelity via statistical text classification (2014) Implementation Science, 9, p. 49. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1748-5908-9-49; Baer, J.S., Rosengren, D.B., Dunn, C.W., Wells, E.A., Ogle, R.L., Hartzler, B., An evaluation of workshop training in motivational interviewing for addiction and mental health clinicians (2004) Drug and Alcohol Dependence, 73, pp. 99-106. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2003.10.001; Baer, J.S., Wells, E.A., Rosengren, D.B., Hartzler, B., Beadnell, B., Dunn, C., Agency context and tailored training in technology transfer: A pilot evaluation of motivational interviewing training for community counselors (2009) Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment, 37, pp. 191-202. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2009.01.003; Bauer, A.M., Baldwin, S.A., Anguera, J.A., Areán, P.A., Atkins, D.C., Comparing approaches to mobile depression assessment for measurement-based care (2018) Journal of Medical Internet Research, 20, p. e10001. , http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/10001; Berger, A.L., Pietra, V.J.D., Pietra, S.A.D., A maximum entropy approach to natural language processing (1996) Computational Linguistics, 22, pp. 39-71; Can, D., Marín, R.A., Georgiou, P.G., Imel, Z.E., Atkins, D.C., Narayanan, S.S., It sounds like..."": A natural language processing approach to detecting counselor reflections in motivational interviewing (2016) Journal of Counseling Psychology, 63, pp. 343-350. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/cou0000111; Creed, T.A., Frankel, S.A., German, R.E., Green, K.L., Jager-Hyman, S., Taylor, K.P., Beck, A.T., Implementation of transdiagnostic cognitive therapy in community behavioral health: The Beck Community Initiative (2016) Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 84, pp. 1116-1126. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/ccp0000105; Domingos, P., A few useful things to know about machine learning (2012) Communications of the ACM, 55, pp. 78-87. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2347736.2347755; Drucker, H., Burges, C.J.C., Kaufman, L., Smola, A.J., Vapnik, V., Support vector regression machines (1997) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 9, pp. 155-161. , http://papers.nips.cc/paper/1238-support-vector-regressionmachines.pdf, In M.

Automated customer service requires big data and expertise in data analysis as prerequisites. However, many companies, especially small and medium enterprises, do not have sufficient data and experience due to their limited scale and resources. They need to rely on third parties, and this reliance results in the lack of development of core customer service competency. In order to overcome these challenges, an open and automated customer service platform based on Internet of things (IoT), blockchain, and automated machine learning (AutoML) is proposed. The data are gathered with the use of IoT devices during the customer service. An open but secured environment to achieve data trading is ensured by using blockchain. AutoML is adopted to automate the data analysis processes for reducing the reliance of costly experts. The proposed platform is analyzed through use case evaluation. A prototype system has also been developed and evaluated. The simulation results show that our platform is scalable and efficient. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Automated customer service; automated machine learning (AutoML); blockchain; open customer service","Automation; Blockchain; Data handling; Information analysis; Machine learning; Sales; Simulation platform; Analysis process; Automated machines; Automated services; Customer services; Internet of Things (IOT); Prototype system; Quality services; Small and medium enterprise; Internet of things","Cheung, C.F., Lee, W.B., Wang, W.M., Chu, K.F., To, S., A multiperspective knowledge-based system for customer service management (2003) Expert Syst.

Given the complexity of discovering new network designs, methods for speeding up the search procedure are becoming important. This paper presents a so-called transferable AutoML approach that leverages previously trained models to speed up the search process for new tasks and datasets. Our approach involves a novel meta-feature extraction technique based on the performance of benchmark models, and a dynamic dataset clustering algorithm based on Markov process and statistical hypothesis test. As such multiple models can share a common structure while with different learned parameters. The transferable AutoML can either be applied to search from scratch, search from predesigned models, or transfer from basic cells according to the difficulties of the given datasets.

Design/methodology/approach: An AutoML method is purposed to model delivery satisfaction of individual customer, and a heuristic method and multi-agent system are proposed to improve overall satisfaction under limited processing capability. A series of simulation experiments have been conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Findings: The simulated results show that the proposed method can effectively improve overall delivery satisfaction, especially when the demand of customer orders is highly fluctuating and when the customer satisfaction models are highly diversified. Practical implications: The proposed framework provides a more dynamic and continuously improving way to model delivery satisfaction of individual customer, thereby supports companies to provide personalized services and develop scalable and flexible business at a lower cost, and ultimately improves the overall quality, efficiency and effectiveness of delivery services. Originality/value: The proposed methodology utilizes AutoML and multi-agent system to model individual customer delivery satisfaction and improve the overall satisfaction. It can cooperate with the existing delivery resource planning methods to further improve customer delivery satisfaction. The authors propose an AutoML approach to model individual customer delivery satisfaction, which enables continuous update and improvements. The authors propose multi-agent system and a heuristic method to improve overall delivery satisfaction. The numerical results show that the proposed method can improve overall delivery satisfaction with limited processing capability. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","AutoML; Customer delivery satisfaction;

Due to the huge model search space, it is impossible to try all models. Users tend to distrust automatic results and increase the search budget as much as they can, thereby undermining the efficiency of AutoML. To address these issues, we design and implement ATMSeer, an interactive visualization tool that supports users in refining the search space of AutoML and analyzing the results. To guide the design of ATMSeer, we derive a workflow of using AutoML based on interviews with machine learning experts. A multi-granularity visualization is proposed to enable users to monitor the AutoML process, analyze the searched models, and refine the search space in real time. We demonstrate the utility and usability of ATMSeer through two case studies, expert interviews, and a user study with 13 end users. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Automated machine learning; Data visualization","Automation; Budget control; Data visualization; Human computer interaction; Human engineering; Learning algorithms; Visualization; Automated machines; Case-studies; Design and implements; Hyperparameters; Interactive visualization tool; Model search; Multi-granularity; Search spaces; Machine learning","Ahmed, N., Atiya, A., Gayar, N., El-Shishiny, H., An empirical comparison of machine learning models for time series forecasting (2010) Econometric Reviews, 29 (5-6), pp. 594-621. , 2010; Amershi, S., Chickering, M., Drucker, S.M., Lee, B., Simard, P., Suh, J., ModelTracker: Redesigning performance analysis tools for machine learning (2015) Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 337-346. , ACM; Box, G.E.P., Stuart Hunter, J., Hunter, W.G., (2005) Statistics for Experimenters: Design, Innovation, and Discovery, 2. , Wiley-Interscience New York; Caruana, R., Niculescu-Mizil, A., An empirical comparison of supervised learning algorithms (2006) Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 161-168. , ACM; Dheeru, D., Taniskidou, E.K., (2017) UCI Machine Learning Repository, , http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml; Fernández-Delgado, M., Cernadas, E., Barro, S., Amorim, D., Do we need hundreds of classifiers to solve real world classification problems?

Risk prediction models currently recommended by clinical guidelines are typically based on a limited number of predictors with sub-optimal performance across all patient groups. Data-driven techniques based on machine learning (ML) might improve the performance of risk predictions by agnostically discovering novel risk predictors and learning the complex interactions between them. We tested (1) whether ML techniques based on a state-of-the-art automated ML framework (AutoPrognosis) could improve CVD risk prediction compared to traditional approaches, and (2) whether considering non-traditional variables could increase the accuracy of CVD risk predictions. Methods and findings Using data on 423,604 participants without CVD at baseline in UK Biobank, we developed a ML-based model for predicting CVD risk based on 473 available variables. Our ML-based model was derived using AutoPrognosis, an algorithmic tool that automatically selects and tunes ensembles of ML modeling pipelines (comprising data imputation, feature processing, classification and calibration algorithms). We compared our model with a well-established risk prediction algorithm based on conventional CVD risk factors (Framingham score), a Cox proportional hazards (PH) model based on familiar risk factors (i.e, age, gender, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, history of diabetes, reception of treatments for hypertension and body mass index), and a Cox PH model based on all of the 473 available variables. Predictive performances were assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). Overall, our AutoPrognosis model improved risk prediction (AUC-ROC: 0.774, 95% CI: 0.768-0.780) compared to Framingham score (AUC-ROC: 0.724, 95% CI: 0.720-0.728, p < 0.001), Cox PH model with conventional risk factors (AUC-ROC: 0.734, 95% CI: 0.729-0.739, p < 0.001), and Cox PH model with all UK Biobank variables (AUC-ROC: 0.758, 95% CI: 0.753-0.763, p < 0.001). Out of 4,801 CVD cases recorded within 5 years of baseline, AutoPrognosis was able to correctly predict 368 more cases compared to the Framingham score. Our AutoPrognosis model included predictors that are not usually considered in existing risk prediction models, such as the individuals’ usual walking pace and their self-reported overall health rating. Furthermore, our model improved risk prediction in potentially relevant sub-populations, such as in individuals with history of diabetes. We also highlight the relative benefits accrued from including more information into a predictive model (information gain) as compared to the benefits of using more complex models (modeling gain). Conclusions Our AutoPrognosis model improves the accuracy of CVD risk prediction in the UK Biobank population. This approach performs well in traditionally poorly served patient subgroups. Additionally, AutoPrognosis uncovered novel predictors for CVD disease that may now be tested in prospective studies. We found that the “information gain” achieved by considering more risk factors in the predictive model was significantly higher than the “modeling gain” achieved by adopting complex predictive models. © 2019 Alaa et al.

In particular, machine learning is currently one of the most popular approaches for hourly solar forecasting. Nevertheless, there is evidently a myth on forecast accuracy—virtually all research papers claim superiority over others. Apparently, the “best” model can only be selected with hindsight, i.e., after empirical evaluation. For any new forecasting project, it is irrational for solar forecasters to bet on a single model from the start. In this article, the hourly forecasting performance of 68 machine learning algorithms is evaluated for 3 sky conditions, 7 locations, and 5 climate zones in the continental United States. To ensure a fair comparison, no hybrid model is considered, and only off-the-shelf implementations of these algorithms are used. Moreover, all models are trained using the automatic tuning algorithm available in the R caret package. It is found that tree-based methods consistently perform well in terms of two-year overall results, however, they rarely stand out during daily evaluation. Although no universal model can be found, some preferred ones for each sky and climate condition are advised. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Automatic machine learning, Solar forecasting, R caret package","Climate models; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Automatic tuning; Climate condition; Empirical evaluations; Forecast accuracy; Forecasting performance; Machine learning models; Solar forecasting; Tree-based methods; Machine learning","IEA, P.V.P.S., http://www.iea-pvps.org/fileadmin/dam/public/report/statistics/IEA-PVPS_-_A_Snapshot_of_Global_PV_-_1992-2017.pdf, Snapshot of global photovoltaic markets.

By integrating machine learning (ML) techniques, power line modems (PLMs) are shown to be capable of automatically detecting, locating, and assessing different types of cable degradations and faults by monitoring and analyzing their estimated channel frequency responses. However, a single ML algorithm is not ideal for all different diagnostics tasks. To aid us in choosing the most suitable ML algorithm(s) for each of the tasks and to make our solution layman accessible, we propose the use of automated ML, which automatically constructs the best ML model from various algorithms and preprocessing techniques for any given diagnostics task. Our proposed diagnostics approach accelerates the practical deployment of PLM-based grid monitoring by providing a ready-to-use solution to utilities that can be applied without detailed domain knowledge of ML operations. © 2019 IEEE.","asset monitoring; AutoML; cable diagnostics; machine learning; Smart grid monitoring","Cables; Carrier transmission on power lines; Electric power measurement; Electric power transmission networks; Frequency response; Learning systems; Modems; Smart power grids; Asset monitoring; AutoML; Domain knowledge; Estimated channels; Integrating machines; Power line communications; Preprocessing techniques; Smart grid; Machine learning","Fawkes, S., (2016) Energy Efficiency: The Definitive Guide to the Cheapest, Cleanest, Fastest Source of Energy, , Routledge; Shields, F.J., The problem of arcing faults in low-voltage power distribution systems (1967) IEEE Trans.

This can cause major additional costs leading to negative impacts for software maintenance since those shortcuts might need to be reworked in the future. Detecting technical debt early can help a team cope with those risks. In this paper, we focus on Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) that is a debt intentionally produced by developers. We propose an automated model to identify two most common types of self-admitted technical debt, requirement and design debt, from source code comments. We combine N-gram IDF and auto-sklearn machine learning to build the model. With the empirical evaluation on ten projects, our approach outperform the baseline method by improving the performance over 20% when identifying requirement self-admitted technical debt and achieving an average F1-score of 64% when identifying design self-admitted technical debt. © 2018 IEEE.","Automated-machine-learning; Comment-classification; N-gram-IDF; Self-admitted-technical-debt","Software engineering; Automated machines; Automated modeling; Empirical evaluations; N-grams; Source code comments; Suitable solutions; Technical debts; Trivial solutions; Machine learning","Cunningham, W., The wycash portfolio management system (1992) SIGPLAN OOPS Mess., 4 (2), pp. 29-30. , Dec; Potdar, A., Shihab, E., An exploratory study on self-admitted technical debt (2014) 2014 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution, pp. 91-100. , Sept; Nord, R.L., Ozkaya, I., Kruchten, P., Gonzalez-Rojas, M., In search of a metric for managing architectural technical debt (2012) 2012 Joint Working IEEE/IFIP Conference on Software Architecture and European Conference on Software Architecture, pp. 91-100. , Aug; Zazworka, N., Spínola, R.O., Vetro', A., Shull, F., Seaman, C., A case study on effectively identifying technical debt (2013) Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering, Ser.

This attitudes expressed by the consumer's seem to be most useful for the new customers who is interested on any product. Meanwhile, an ever increasing number of reviews and comments are being stored daily and the amount of people buying goods online are increasing in a great extent. User emotions record associated with every products is beneficial for both the makers as well as customers. But with the increasing number of datasets in the e-commerce websites, it has almost become impossible for manual analysis and without automated machine learning approach it can't be even imagined. Therefore, improvement in the field of machine learning approaches must be accomplished. Realizing the worth of this, this work proposes a hybrid machine learning approach by incorporating different machine learning approaches. Own Bangla StopWords database consisting of approximately 900words have also been concentrated in this work. Initially, input data are tokenized using python NLTK library and filtered using StopWords created. Then conversion of data to numerical from string are conducted using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) information retrieval mechanism and finally trained using K-nearest neighbor (KNN) with Support Vector Machine (SVM). Our proposed approach Normalization along with StopWords filtering embedded KNN based SVM demonstrates superiority after a comparative study with Principle Component Analysis (PCA) with Convolutional neural network (CNN), Random Forest, Logistic Regression. © 2019 IEEE.","Bangla StopWords Database; E-commerce sites; K Nearest Neighbor (KNN); Random Forest.; Support Vector Machine (SVM)","Convolutional neural networks; Data handling; Decision trees; Electronic commerce; Logistic regression; Nearest neighbor search; Principal component analysis; Support vector machines; Text processing; Comparative studies; E-commerce websites; Hybrid machine learning; K nearest neighbor (KNN); Machine learning approaches; Principle component analysis; Sentiment classification; Term frequency-inverse document frequencies; Learning systems","Bakshi, R.K., Kaur, N., Kaur, R., Kaur, G., Opinion mining and sentiment analysis (2016) 2016 3rd International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development (INDiACom), pp. 452-455. , New Delhi; Wang, W., Zhou, Y., E-business websites evaluation based on opinion mining (2009) 2009 International Conference on Electronic Commerce and Business Intelligence, pp. 87-90. , Beijing; Zhao, Y., The review of web mining in e-commerce (2013) 2013 International Conference on Computational and Information Sciences, pp. 571-574. , Shiyang; Kumari, N., Singh, S.N., Sentiment analysis on e-commerce application by using opinion mining (2016) 2016 6th International Conference-Cloud System and Big Data Engineering (Confluence), pp. 320-325. , Noida; Mittal, S., Goel, A., Jain, R., Sentiment analysis of e-commerce and social networking sites (2016) 2016 3rd International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development (INDiACom), pp. 2300-2305. , New Delhi; Bordoloi, M., Biswas, S.K., E-commerce sentiment analysis using graph based approach (2017) 2017 International Conference on Inventive Computing and Informatics (ICICI), pp. 570-575. , Coimbatore; Anto, M.P., Antony, M., Muhsina, K.M., Johny, N., James, V., Wilson, A., Product rating using sentiment analysis (2016) 2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT), pp. 3458-3462. , Chennai; Alrababah, S.A.A.A., Gan, K.H., Tan, T., Product aspect ranking using sentiment analysis and topsis (2016) 2016 Third International Conference on Information Retrieval and Knowledge Management (CAMP), pp. 13-19. , Bandar Hilir; Wajgi, R.D., Bagul, S.J., Design feedback analysis system for ecommerce organization (2016) 2016 World Conference on Futuristic Trends in Research and Innovation for Social Welfare (Startup Conclave), pp. 1-4. , Coimbatore","IEEE Int.

In addition, manual scoring often omits information on SWD confidence/intensity, which may be important for the investigation of mechanistic-based research questions. Our objective is to develop an automated method for the detection of SWDs in a mouse model of absence epilepsy that is focused on the characteristics of human scoring of preselected events to establish a confidence-based, continuous-valued scoring. Methods: We develop a support vector machine (SVM)–based algorithm for the automated detection of SWDs in the γ2R43Q mouse model of absence epilepsy. The algorithm first identifies putative SWD events using frequency- and amplitude-based peak detection. Four humans scored a set of 2500 putative events identified by the algorithm. Then, using predictors calculated from the wavelet transform of each event and the labels from human scoring, we trained an SVM to classify (SWD/nonSWD) and assign confidence scores to each event identified from 60, 24-hour EEG records. We provide a detailed assessment of intra- and interrater scoring that demonstrates advantages of automated scoring. Results: The algorithm scored SWDs along a continuum that is highly correlated with human confidence and that allows us to more effectively characterize ambiguous events. We demonstrate that events along our scoring continuum are temporally and proportionately correlated with abrupt changes in spectral power bands relevant to normal behavioral states including sleep. Significance: Although there are automated and semi-automated methods for the detection of SWDs in humans and rats, we contribute to the need for continued development of SWD detection in mice. Our results demonstrate the value of viewing detection of SWDs as a continuous classification problem to better understand “ground truth” in SWD detection (ie, the most reliable features agreed upon by humans that also correlate with objective physiologic measures). © 2019 The Authors.

The GA-level encodes the macro structure of evolution, i.e., the layers, learning, and/or data augmentation methods (among others); the DSGE-level specifies the parameters of each GA evolutionary unit and the valid range of the parameters. The use of a grammar makes DENSER a general purpose framework for generating DNNs: one just needs to adapt the grammar to be able to deal with different network and layer types, problems, or even to change the range of the parameters. DENSER is tested on the automatic generation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the CIFAR-10 dataset, with the best performing networks reaching accuracies of up to 95.22%. Furthermore, we take the fittest networks evolved on the CIFAR-10, and apply them to classify MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, SVHN, Rectangles, and CIFAR-100. The results show that the DNNs discovered by DENSER during evolution generalise, are robust, and scale. The most impressive result is the 78.75% classification accuracy on the CIFAR-100 dataset, which, to the best of our knowledge, sets a new state-of-the-art on methods that seek to automatically design CNNs. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Automated machine learning; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Dynamic structured grammatical evolution; NeuroEvolution","Classification (of information); Computational grammars; Convolution; Deep neural networks; Genetic algorithms; Neural networks; Automated machines; Classification accuracy; Convolutional neural network; Evolutionary approach; General purpose framework; Genetic algorithm (GAs); Grammatical evolution; Neuro evolutions; Network layers","Abadi, M., Barham, P., Chen, J., Chen, Z., Davis, A., Dean, J., Devin, M., Isard, M., Tensorflow: a system for large-scale machine learning (2016) OSDI, 16, pp. 265-283; Ahmadizar, F., Soltanian, K., AkhlaghianTab, F., Tsoulos, I., Artificial neural network development by means of a novel combination of grammatical evolution and genetic algorithm (2015) Eng.

The proposed hybrid prognostics method can be divided into two phases. In the first phase, the automatic machine learning algorithm that based on the evolutionary algorithm and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system is proposed to predict the long-term degradation trend. In the second phase, based on the degradation data obtained in the first phase, the remaining useful life estimation is implemented by using a semi-empirical degradation model of PEMFCs and the proposed adaptive Unscented Kalman filter algorithm. Finally, the proposed hybrid prognostics method is validated by using the aging experimental data of PEMFCs. Test results show that the proposed hybrid prognostics method can achieve accurate long-term degradation trend prediction and remaining useful life estimation for PEMFCs. © 2019","Adaptive Unscented Kalman filter; Automatic machine learning; Prognostics; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells; Remaining useful life","Adaptive filtering; Evolutionary algorithms; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Gas fuel purification; Inference engines; Kalman filters; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Systems engineering; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Automatic machines; Degradation model; Degradation trend; Prognostics; Proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFCs); Remaining useful lives; Unscented Kalman Filter; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); fuel cell; genetic algorithm; ion exchange; Kalman filter; long-term change; machine learning; model validation","Sharaf, O.Z., Orhan, M.F., An overview of fuel cell technology: fundamentals and applications (2014) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 32 (5), pp. 810-853; Wang, Y., Chen, K.S., Mishler, J., Cho, S.C., Adroher, X.C., A review of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells: technology, applications, and needs on fundamental research (2011) Appl Energy, 88 (4), pp. 981-1007; Jouin, M., Bressel, M., Morando, S., Gouriveau, R., Hissel, D., Pera, M.C., Estimating the end-of-life of PEM fuel cells: guidelines and metrics (2016) Appl Energy, 177, pp. 87-97; Sutharssan, T., Montalvao, D., Chen, Y.K., Wang, W.C., Pisac, C., Elemara, H., A review on prognostics and health monitoring of proton exchange membrane fuel cell (2016) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 75, pp. 440-450; Jouin, M., Gouriveau, R., Hissel, D., Pera, M.C., Zerhouni, N., Prognostics of PEM fuel cell in a particle filtering framework (2014) Int J Hydrogen Energy, 39 (1), pp. 481-494; Bressel, M., Hilairet, M., Hissel, D., Bouamama, B.O., Extended kalman filter for prognostic of proton exchange membrane fuel cell (2016) Appl Energy, 164, pp. 220-227; Dacheng, Z., Catherine, C., Nadia, Y.-S., Christophe, B., Proton exchange membrane fuel cell remaining useful life prognostics considering degradation recovery phenomena (2018) J Risk Reliab, 232 (4), pp. 415-424; Robin, C., Gerard, M., Franco, A.A., Schott, P., Multi-scale coupling between two dynamical models for PEMFC aging prediction (2013) Int J Hydrogen Energy, 38 (11), pp. 4675-4688; Polverino, P., Pianese, C., (2016), pp. 599-604. , Model-based prognostic algorithm for online RUL estimation of PEMFCs.

A recently developed 3DE machine learning (ML) approach allows automated determination of LV mass. We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of this new approach by comparing it to cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) reference and to conventional 3DE volumetric analysis. Methods: We prospectively studied 23 patients who underwent 3DE (Philips EPIQ) and CMR imaging on the same day. Single-beat wide-angle 3D datasets of the left ventricle were acquired. LV mass was quantified using the new automated software (Philips HeartModel) with manual corrections when necessary and using conventional volumetric analysis (TomTec). CMR analysis was performed by manual slice-by-slice tracing of LV endo- and epicardial boundaries. Reproducibility of the ML approach was assessed using repeated measurements and quantified by intra-class correlation (ICC) and coefficients of variation (CoV). Results: Automated LV mass measurements were feasible in 20 patients (87%). The results were similar to CMR-derived values (Bland-Altman bias 5 g, limits of agreement ±37 g) and also to the conventional 3DE analysis (bias 7 g, ±27 g). Processing time was considerably shorter: 1.02 ± 0.24 minutes (CMR: 2.20 ± 0.13 minutes; TomTec: 2.36 ± 0.09 minutes), although manual corrections were performed in most patients. Repeated measurements showed high reproducibility: ICC = 0.99; CoV = 4 ± 5%. Conclusions: 3D Echocardiography analysis of LV mass using novel ML-based algorithm is feasible, fast, and accurate and may thus facilitate the incorporation of 3DE measurements of LV mass into clinical practice. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","2D echocardiography;

In order to make deep learning available for a broader audience, automated methods for finding a neural network architecture are vital. Recently proposed methods can already achieve human expert level performances. However, these methods have run times of months or even years of GPU computing time, ignoring hardware constraints as faced by many researchers and companies. We propose the use of Monte Carlo planning in combination with two different UCT (upper confidence bound applied to trees) derivations to search for network architectures. We adapt the UCT algorithm to the needs of network architecture search by proposing two ways of sharing information between different branches of the search tree. In an empirical study we are able to demonstrate that this method is able to find competitive networks for MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR-10 in just a single GPU day.

More specifically, we focus on mortality and polypharmacy prediction. We also examine the balance between interpretability and predictive performance for both prediction tasks, and compare performance of interpretable models with models generated with automated methods. Our results show good predictive performance in the polypharmacy prediction task with AUC of 0.859 (95% CI: 0.857–0.861). On the other hand, we were only able to achieve the average predictive performance for mortality prediction task with AUC of 0.754 (0.747–0.761). It was also shown that adding additional drug related features increased the performance only in the polypharmacy prediction task, while additional information on prescribed drugs did not influence the performance in the mortality prediction. Despite the limited success in mortality prediction, this study demonstrates the added value of the systematic collection and use of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data in solving the problem of polypharmacy related complications in older age. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Automated machine learning; Diabetes; Drug prescription; Interpretability; Logistic regression; Mortality prediction; Polypharmacy prediction","Large dataset; Machine learning; Statistical tests; Added values; Automated methods; Drug prescriptions; Electronic health record; Interpretability; Prediction tasks; Predictive performance; Type 2 diabetes mellitus; Forecasting","Saely, C.H., Vonbank, A., Lins, C, Type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and mortality in patients with established cardiovascular disease (2017) Eur.

Automated Machine Learning (Auto-ML) methods have been recently proposed to tackle this issue. Auto-ML tools aim to automatically choose the best classification workflow for a given dataset. In this work we analyse the predictive accuracy and overfit of the state-of-the-art auto-sklearn tool, which iteratively builds a classification ensemble optimised for the user’s dataset. This work has 3 contributions. First, we measure 3 types of auto-sklearn’s overfit, involving the differences of predictive accuracies measured on different data subsets: two parts of the training set (for learning and internal validation of the model) and the hold-out test set used for final evaluation. Second, we analyse the distribution of types of classification models selected by auto-sklearn across all 17 datasets. Third, we measure correlations between predictive accuracies on different data subsets and different types of overfitting. Overall, substantial degrees of overfitting were found in several datasets, and decision tree ensembles were the most frequently selected types of models. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Automated Machine Learning; Classification; Overfit","Automation; Decision trees; Iterative methods; Machine learning; Automated machines; Classification algorithm; Classification ensembles; Classification models; Hyper-parameter; Overfit; Predictive accuracy; State of the art; Classification (of information)","Feurer, M., Eggensperger, K., Falkner, S., Lindauer, M., Hutter, F., Practical automated machine learning for the automl challenge 2018 (2018) International Workshop on Automatic Machine Learning, ICML 2018, pp. 1-12; Feurer, M., Hutter, F., Towards further automation in AutoML (2018) ICML Automl Workshop, p. 13; Feurer, M., Klein, A., Eggensperger, K., Springenberg, J., Blum, M., Hutter, F., Efficient and robust automated machine learning (2015) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 28, pp. 2962-2970. , Curran Associates, Inc; Guyon, I., A brief review of the ChaLearn AutoML challenge: Any-time any-dataset learning without human intervention (2016) Workshop on Automatic Machine Learning, pp. 21-30; Japkowicz, N., Shah, M., (2011) Evaluating Learning Algorithms a Classification Perspective, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Kordík, P., Černỳ, J., Frỳda, T., Discovering predictive ensembles for transfer learning and meta-learning (2018) Mach.

Auto-ML methods normally maximize only predictive accuracy, ignoring the classification model’s interpretability – an important criterion in many applications. Hence, we propose a novel approach, based on Auto-ML, to investigate the trade-off between the predictive accuracy and the interpretability of classification-model representations. The experiments used the Auto-WEKA tool to investigate this trade-off. We distinguish between white box (interpretable) model representations and two other types of model representations: black box (non-interpretable) and grey box (partly interpretable). We consider as white box the models based on the following 6 interpretable knowledge representations: decision trees, If-Then classification rules, decision tables, Bayesian network classifiers, nearest neighbours and logistic regression. The experiments used 16 datasets and two runtime limits per Auto-WEKA run: 5 h and 20 h. Overall, the best white box model was more accurate than the best non-white box model in 4 of the 16 datasets in the 5-hour runs, and in 7 of the 16 datasets in the 20-hour runs. However, the predictive accuracy differences between the best white box and best non-white box models were often very small. If we accept a predictive accuracy loss of 1% in order to benefit from the interpretability of a white box model representation, we would prefer the best white box model in 8 of the 16 datasets in the 5-hour runs, and in 10 of the 16 datasets in the 20-hour runs. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2019.","Automated Machine Learning (Auto-ML); Classification algorithms; Interpretable models","Automation; Bayesian networks; Classification (of information); Data mining; Decision making; Decision tables; Decision trees; Economic and social effects; Extraction; Knowledge representation; Learning algorithms; Automated machines; Bayesian network classifiers; Classification algorithm; Classification models; Classification rules; Logistic regressions; Model representation; Predictive accuracy; Machine learning","Barros, R.C., Basgalupp, M.P., de Carvalho, A.C.P.L.F., Freitas, A.A., A survey of evolutionary algorithms for decision tree induction (2012) IEEE Trans.

The success of such evaluations is largely driven by the analysis of the data accumulated during the asset's operational cycle. Usually, the amount of data stored in the databases dramatically exceeds the ability to approach the analysis with traditional spreadsheet-based tools or linear modeling. In this study we use data mining with multivariate predictive analytics and monetize on the value of data by transforming the inferred information into knowledge and further into rigorous business decisions. With the expansion of the Digital Oil Field and transformation into the 4th Industrial Revolution, the oil and gas industry is acquiring tremendous amounts of data that come from disparate sources in a variety of origins, time scales, structures and quality. The underlying variable root-cause relationships are highly nonlinear and non-intuitive, and simplistic linear regression methods are suboptimal. We approach the challenge by developing a data-driven workflow that integrates components of artificial intelligence, machine learning and pattern recognition to enhance quantitative understanding of complex data. The sanitized aggregated data set combines 470 horizontal wells, covering 15 numerical (e.g., stimulation interval length, production rates) and categorical (e.g., target zone, proppant type) predictors and the total produced BOE, as the response variable. The objective is to predict an optimal set of variables that maximize the production. We utilize an integrated analytics platform that enables a variety of sophisticated statistical operations on large-scale data: a) comprehensive data QA/QC for outliers, consistency and missing entries; b) Exploratory Data Analysis and visualization; c) feature selection, screening and ranking; d) building and training of multiple machine learning (ML) models for multi-variate regression (e.g. generalized linear model, deep learning, decision tree, random forest and gradient boosted machine); and e) response optimization of an identified ""best-performing"" ML model for highest prediction accuracy. Our study introduces the initiative to establish concepts best practices for predictive and prescriptive analytics in domains of reservoir simulation, description and asset management. Given the unique volume and information richness of operational data, acquired over decades of production history, the anticipated applications of predictive analytics could expand to drilling optimization, smart data aggregation, well stimulation and equipment maintenance. © 2019, Society of Petroleum Engineers.",,"Data mining; Data visualization; Decision trees; Deep learning; Drilling equipment; Forecasting; Gas industry; Gasoline; Horizontal wells; Machine components; Machine learning; Oil fields; Pattern recognition; Petroleum industry; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Predictive analytics; Regression analysis; Reservoir management; Well stimulation; Drilling optimization; Equipment maintenance; Exploratory data analysis; Generalized linear model; Industrial revolutions; Information richness; Linear regression methods; Operational efficiencies; Metadata","Braswell, G., (2013) Artificial Intelligence Come of Age in Oil and Gas, , https://doi.org/10.2118/0113-0050-JPT, SPE-0113-0050-JPT; Bravo, C., Saputelli, L., Rivas, F., Pérez, A.G., Nikolaou, M., Zangl, G., (2014) State of the Art of Artificial Intelligence and Predictive Analytics in the E&P Industry: A Technology Survey, , https://doi.org/10.2118/150314-PA, SPE 150314-PA; Breiman, L., Friedman, J.H., Olshen, R.A., Stone, C.J., (1984) Classification and Regression Trees, , London: Chapman & Hall; Carvajal, G., Maucec, M., Cullick, S., (2018) Intelligent Digital Oil and Gas Fields: Concepts, Collaboration, and Right-Time Decisions, , Gulf Professional Publishing (an imprint of Elsevier), Cambridge, MA; Crnkovic-Friis, L., Erlandson, M., (2015) Geology Driven EUR Prediction Using Deep Learning, , https://doi.org/10.2118/174799-MS, SPE-174799-MS; Deutsch, C.V., (2002) Geostatistical Reservoir Modeling, , New York: Oxford University Press; Domingos, P., A few useful things to know about machine learning (2012) Communication of the ACM, 55 (10), pp. 78-87; Dossary, M., Al-Turki, A., Harbi, B., (2016) Self-Organizing Maps for Regions Exploring and Identification Based on Geological Signatures, Similarities and Anomalies, , https://doi.org/10.2118/182827-MS, SPE-182827-MS; Goodfellow, I., Bengio, Y., Courville, A., (2016) Deep Learning, , http://www.deeplearningbook.org, MIT Press; Gupta, S., Nikolaou, M., Saputelli, L., Panjwani, S., Applying predictive analytics to detect and diagnose impending problems in electric submersible pumps used for lifting oil from wellbores (2015) AIChE Annual Meeting, , https://aiche.confex.com/aiche/2015/webprogram/ataglance.html, Paper 419054, Salt Lake City, UT, USA, Nov 8-13, 2015; James, G., Witten, D., Hastie, T., Tibshirani, R., (2014) An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R, , Springer, NY; Kuzma, H.A., Arora, N.S., Farid, K., (2014) Generative Models for Production Forecasting in Unconventional Oil and Gas Plays, , URTeC: 1928595; Maucec, M., Bhattacharya, S., Yarus, J.M., Fulton, D.D., Singh, A.P., (2012) System, Method and Computer Program Product for Multivariate Statistical Validation of Well Treatment and Stimulation Data, , PCT Patent Application; Maucec, M., Singh, A.P., Bhattacharya, S., Yarus, J., Fulton, D., Orth, J., (2013) Multivariate Analysis of Job Pause Time Data Using Classification and Regression Tree and Kernel Clustering, , https://doi.org/10.2118/167399-MS, SPE-167399-MS; Maucec, M., Singh, A.P., Bhattacharya, S., Yarus, J., Fulton, D., Orth, J., (2015) Multivariate Analysis and Data Mining of Well Stimulation Data Using Classification and Regression Tree with Enhanced Interpretation and Prediction Capabilities, , https://doi.org/10.2118/166472-PA, SPE-166472-PA; Mohaghegh, S.D., (2005) Recent Developments in Application of Artificial Intelligence in Petroleum Engineering, , https://doi.org/10.2118/89033-JPT, SPE-89033-JPT; Razzak, M.I., Naz, S., Zaib, A., (2017) Deep Learning for Medical Image Processing: Overview, Challenges and Future, , arXiv preprint; Schuetter, J., Mishra, S., Zhong, M., LaFolette, R.F., (2015) Data Analytics for Production Optimization in Unconventional Reservoirs, , https://doi.org/10.15530/URTEC-2015-2167005, URTEC-2167005-MS; Shirangi, M.G., (2012) Applying Machine Learning Algorithms to Oil Reservoir Production Optimization, , http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2012/Shirangi-ApplyingMachineLearningAlgorithmsToOilReservoirProductionOptimization.pdf; (2012) Electronic Statistics Textbook, , StatSoft.

Research has shown that with today’s computational power and advanced machine learning algorithms it is possible to build models to predict bookings cancellation likelihood. However, the effectiveness of these models has never been evaluated in a real environment. To fill this gap and investigate how these models can be implemented in a decision support system and its impact on demand-management decisions, a prototype was built and deployed in two hotels. The prototype, based on an automated machine learning system designed to learn continuously, lead to two important research contributions. First, the development of a training method and weighting mechanism designed to capture changes in cancellations patterns over time and learn from previous days’ predictions hits and errors. Second, the creation of a new measure - Minimum Frequency - to measure the precision of predictions over time. From a business standpoint, the prototype demonstrated its effectiveness, with results exceeding 84% in accuracy, 82% in precision, and 88% in Area Under the Curve (AUC). The system allowed hotels to predict their net demand and thus making better decisions about which bookings to accept and reject, what prices to make, and how many rooms to oversell. The systematic prediction of bookings with high probability of being canceled allowed hotels to reduce cancellations by 37 percentage points by acting to avoid their cancellation. © 2019 The Author(s).","A/B testing; Data science; Decision support systems; Machine learning; Predictive analytics; Revenue management","Data Science; Decision making; Forecasting; Hotels; Information management; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Predictive analytics; A/b testing; Area under the curves; Automated machines; Computational power; Hospitality industry; On-demand management; Percentage points; Revenue management; Decision support systems","Abbott, D., (2014) Applied predictive analytics: Principles and techniques for the professional data analyst, , Indianapolis, IN, USA: Wiley; Abe, N., Zadrozny, B., Langford, J., An iterative method for multi-class cost-sensitive learning (2004) Proceedings of the Tenth ACN SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 3-11. , https://doi.org/10.1145/1014052.1014056, Presented at the tenth ACN SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining.

Currently, there is interest to extend traditional ATR methods by employing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). In support of current opportunities, the paper discusses a methodology entitled: Systems Experimentation efficiency effectives Evaluation Networks (SEeeEN). ATR differs from PR in that ATR is a system deployment leveraging pattern recognition (PR) in a networked environment for mission decision making, while PR/ML is a statistical representation of patterns for classification. ATR analysis has long been part of the COMPrehensive Assessment of Sensor Exploitation (COMPASE) Center utilizing measures of performance (e.g., efficiency) and measures of effectiveness (e.g., robustness) for ATR evaluation. The paper highlights available multimodal data sets for Automated ML Target Recognition (AMLTR). © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

The machine learning algorithm trained on dynamic data from shorter time intervals of the engine features together with longer time interval data for the fuel consumption. To give the operator and ship owner real-time energy efficiency statistics, it is essential to be able to predict the dynamic fuel oil consumption. The conventional approach to getting these data is by installing additional mass flow meters, but these come with added cost and complexity. In this study, we propose a machine learning approach using auto machine learning optimisation, with already available data from the machinery logging system. © 2019 The Authors.

We had developed a near-infrared optical scanner (NIROS) that performs noncontact NIR spectroscopic (NIRS) imaging to provide 2D tissue oxygenation maps of the entire wounds. Regions of changed oxygenation have to be demarcated and registered with respect to visual white light images of the wound. Herein, a semi-Automatic image segmentation and co-registration approach using machine learning has been developed to differentiate regions of changed tissue oxygenation. A registration technique was applied using a transformation matrix approach using specific markers across the white light image and the NIR images (or tissue oxygenation maps). This allowed for physiological changes observed from hemodynamic changes to be observed in the RGB white light image as well. Semi-Automated segmentation techniques employing graph cuts algorithms was implemented to demarcate the 2D tissue oxygenation maps depicting regions of increased or decreased oxygenation and further coregistered onto the white light images. The developed registration technique was validated via phantom studies (both flat and curved phantoms) and in-vivo studies on controls, demonstrating an accuracy >97%. The technique was further implemented on wounds (here, diabetic foot ulcers) across weeks of treatment. Regions of decreased oxygenation were demarcated, and its area estimated and co-registered in comparison to the clinically demarcated wound area. Future work involves the development of automated machine learning approaches of image analysis for clinicians to obtain real-Time co-registered clinical and subclinical assessments of the wound. © 2019 SPIE.","Co-registration; Image analysis; Image segmentation; Infrared spectroscopy; Medical and biological imaging; Wounds","Automation; Biopsy; Graphic methods; Image analysis; Infrared devices; Infrared spectroscopy; Laser recording; Linear transformations; Machine learning; Medical imaging; Oxygenation; Phantoms; Scanning; Tissue; Coregistration; Medical and biological imaging; Registration techniques; Semi-automated segmentation; Semi-automatic image segmentation; Spectroscopic imaging; Transformation matrices; Wounds; Image segmentation","Agale, S.V., Chronic leg ulcers: Epidemiology, aetiopathogenesis, and management (2013) Ulcers, 2013; Ramsey, S.D., Newton, K., Blough, D., McCulloch, D.K., Sandhu, N., Reiber, G.E., Wagner, E.H., Incidence, outcomes, and cost of foot ulcers in patients with diabetes (1999) Diabetes Care, 223, pp. 382-387; Mukherjee, R., Tewary, S., Routray, A., Diagnostic and prognostic utility of non-invasive multimodal imaging in chronic wound monitoring: A systematic review (2017) J Med Syst, pp. 41-46; Kwasinski, S., Fernandez, C., Leiva, K., Schutzman, R., Robledo, E., Kallis, P., Borda, L.J., Godavarty, A., Tissue Oxygenation Changes to Assess Healing in Venous Leg Ulcers Using Near-infrared Optical Imaging, , Adv. in Wound Care (submitted Oct 2018; Salah, M.B., Mitiche, A., Ayed, I.B., Multiregion image segmentation by parametric kernel graph cuts (2011) IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 20 (2); Boykov, Y.Y., Jolly, M.P., Interactive graph cuts for optimal boundary & region segmentation of objects in nd images (2001) Proc.

In this study, we used an automated machine-learning-based approach to construct a prognostic model to predict the functional outcome in patients with primary intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Methods: We retrospectively collected data on demographic characteristics, laboratory studies and imaging findings of 333 patients with primary ICH. The functional outcomes at the 1st and 6th months after ICH were defined by the modified Rankin scale. All of the attributes were used for preprocessing and for automatic model selection with Automatic Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis. Confusion matrix and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) were used to test the predictive performance. Results: Among the models tested, the random forest provided the best predictive performance for functional outcome. The overall accuracy for predicting the 1st month outcome was 83.1%, with 77.4% sensitivity and 86.9% specificity, and the AUC was 0.899. The overall accuracy for predicting the 6th month outcome was 83.9%, with 72.5% sensitivity and 90.6% specificity, and the AUC was 0.917. Conclusions: Using an automatic machine learning technique to predict functional outcome after ICH is feasible, and the random forest model provides the best predictive performance across all tested models.

Despite prevention strategies being applied, the rate of suicide has not changed substantially over the past decades. Suicide risk has proven extremely difficult to assess for medical specialists, and traditional methodologies deployed have been ineffective. Advances in machine learning make it possible to attempt to predict suicide with the analysis of relevant data aiming to inform clinical practice. Aims: We aimed to (a) test our artificial intelligence based, referral-centric methodology in the context of the National Health Service (NHS), (b) determine whether statistically relevant results can be derived from data related to previous suicides, and (c) develop ideas for various exploitation strategies. Method: The analysis used data of patients who died by suicide in the period 2013-2016 including both structured data and free-text medical notes, necessitating the deployment of state-of-the-art machine learning and text mining methods. Limitations: Sample size is a limiting factor for this study, along with the absence of non-suicide cases. Specific analytical solutions were adopted for addressing both issues. Results and Conclusion: The results of this pilot study indicate that machine learning shows promise for predicting within a specified period which people are most at risk of taking their own life at the time of referral to a mental health service. © 2018 Hogrefe Publishing.","automated machine learning; clinical data; risk assessment; suicide prevention; text mining","adult; artificial intelligence; automation; data mining; female; human; machine learning; male; medical record; middle aged; multivariate analysis; national health service; patient referral; pilot study; risk assessment; statistics; suicide; support vector machine; United Kingdom; Adult; Artificial Intelligence; Automation; Data Mining; Female; Humans; Machine Learning; Male; Medical Records; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Pilot Projects; Referral and Consultation; Risk Assessment; State Medicine; Statistics as Topic; Suicide; Support Vector Machine; United Kingdom","Bird, S., Klein, E., Loper, E., (2009) Natural Language Processing with Python: Analyzing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit, , Sebastopol, CA: O'Reilly Media; Blei, D.M., Ng, A.Y., Jordan, M.I., Latent dirichlet allocation (2003) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3, pp. 993-1022; Borboudakis, G., Stergiannakos, T., Frysali, M., Klontzas, E., Tsamardinos, I., Froudakis, G.E., Chemically intuited, large-scale screening of MOFs by machine learning techniques (2017) Npj Computational Materials, 3 (1), p. 40; Boser, B.E., Guyon, I.M., Vapnik, V.N., A training algorithm for optimal margin classifiers (1992) Proceedings of the Fifth Annual Workshoon Computational Learning Theory, pp. 144-152. , New York, NY: ACM; Breiman, L., Random forests (2001) Machine Learning, 45 (1), pp. 5-32; Breiman, L., Friedman, J., Stone, C.J., Olshen, R.A., (1984) Classification and Regression Trees, , Boca Raton, FL: CRC press; Carter, G., Milner, A., McGill, K., Pirkis, J., Kapur, N., Spittal, M.J., Predicting suicidal behaviours using clinical instruments: Systematic review and meta-analysis of positive predictive values for risk scales (2017) The British Journal of Psychiatry, 210 (6), pp. 387-395; Chan, M.K., Bhatti, H., Meader, N., Stockton, S., Evans, J., O'Connor, R.C., Kendall, T., Predicting suicide following self-harm: Systematic review of risk factors and risk scales (2016) The British Journal of Psychiatry, 209 (4), pp. 277-283; Chapman, C.L., Mullin, K., Ryan, C.J., Kuffel, A., Nielssen, O., Large, M.M., Meta-analysis of the association between suicidal ideation and later suicide among patients with either a schizophrenia spectrum psychosis or a mood disorder (2015) Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica, 131 (3), pp. 162-173; Delong, E.R., Delong, D.M., Clarke-Pearson, D.L., Comparing the areas under two or more correlated receiver operating characteristic curves: A nonparametric approach (1988) Biometrics, pp. 837-845; (2012) Suicide Prevention: Resources and Guidance and Mental Health Service Reform., , https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/suicide-prevention-strategy-for-england, Department of Health..

The driving force is to reduce the amount of human intervention required to process data and create models for classification and prediction, a tedious and arbitrary process for data scientists that may not often result in achieving a global optimum with respect to multiple objectives. Moreover, existing autoML techniques rely on extremely large collections of relatively clean training data, which is not typical of Multi-Domain Battle (MDB) applications. In this paper, we describe a methodology to optimize underwater seafloor detection for airborne bathymetric lidar, an application domain with sparse truth data, leveraging evolutionary algorithms and genetic programming. Our methodology uses the Evolutionary Multi-objective Algorithm Design Engine (EMADE) and a radiometric waveform simulator generating millions of waveforms from which genetic programming techniques select optimal signal processing techniques and their parameters given the goal of reducing Total Propagated Uncertainty (TPU). The EMADE affords several benefits not found in other autoML solutions, including the ability to stack machine learning models, process time-series data using dozens of signal-processing techniques, and efficiently evaluate algorithms on multiple objectives. Given the lack of truth data, we tune EMADE to produce detection algorithms that improve accuracy and reduce relevant measurement uncertainties for a wide variety of operational and environmental scenarios. Preliminary testing indicates successfully reducing TPU and reducing over-and under-prediction errors by 13.8% and 68.2% respectively, foreshadowing using EMADE to assist in future MDB-Application algorithm development. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

We present: 1) a task analysis of HGML that shows the tasks that a user would want to carry out, 2) a characterization of two scientific publications, one in neuroscience and one in political science, in terms of how the authors would search for solutions using an AutoML system, 3) requirements for HGML based on those characterizations, and 4) an assessment of existing AutoML systems in terms of those requirements. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).","Automated machine learning (AutoML); Human-guided machine learning; Scientific workflows; Task analysis","Automation; Job analysis; User interfaces; Automated machines; Fully automated; Hybrid approach; Large spaces; Political science; Scientific publications; Scientific workflows; Task analysis; Machine learning","Thornton, C., Hutter, F., Hoos, H.H., Leyton-Brown, K., Auto-Weka: Combined selection and hyperparameter optimization of classification algorithms (2013) Proc.

We propose a novel neuro-evolutionary technique to solve this problem without human interference. Our method assumes that a convolutional neural network architecture is a sequence of neuro-cells and keeps mutating them using function-preserving operations. This novel combination of approaches has several advantages. We define the network architecture by a sequence of repeating neuro-cells which reduces the search space complexity. Furthermore, these cells are possibly transferable and can be used in order to arbitrarily extend the complexity of the network. Mutations based on function-preserving operations guarantee better parameter initialization than random initialization such that less training time is required per network architecture. Our proposed method finds within 12 GPU hours neural network architectures that can achieve a classification error of about 4% and 24% with only 5.5 and 6.5 million parameters on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively. In comparison to competitor approaches, our method provides similar competitive results but requires orders of magnitudes less search time and in many cases less network parameters. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Automated machine learning; Evolutionary algorithms; Neural architecture search","Cells; Complex networks; Convolution; Cytology; Deep learning; Evolutionary algorithms; Machine learning; Neural networks; Automated machines; Classification errors; Convolutional neural network; Evolutionary techniques; Human interference; Learning architectures; Neural architectures; Orders of magnitude; Network architecture","Baker, B., Gupta, O., Naik, N., Raskar, R., Designing neural network architectures using reinforcement learning (2017) Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations, , ICLR 2017, Toulon, France, 24–26 April; Bergstra, J., Bengio, Y., Random search for hyper-parameter optimization (2012) J.

This paper introduces a semantics-driven automated approach for solving population health problems with descriptive statistical models. A fusion of semantic and machine learning techniques enables our semantically-targeted analytics framework to automatically discover informative subpopulations that have subpopulation-specific risk factors significantly associated with health conditions such as hypertension and type II diabetes. Based on our health analysis ontology and knowledge graphs, the semantically-targeted analysis automated architecture allows analysts to rapidly and dynamically conduct studies for different health outcomes, risk factors, cohorts, and analysis methods; it also lets the full analysis pipeline be modularly specified in a reusable domain-specific way through the usage of knowledge graph cartridges, which are application-specific fragments of the underlying knowledge graph. We evaluate the semantically-targeted analysis framework for risk analysis using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and conclude that this framework can be readily extended to solve many different learning and statistical tasks, and to exploit datasets from various domains in the future.

To ease this process, we can resort to methods that seek to automatically optimise either the topology or simultaneously the topology and learning parameters of ANNs. The main issue of such approaches is that they require large amounts of computational resources, and take a long time to generate a solution that is considered acceptable for the problem at hand. The current paper extends Deep Evolutionary Network Structured Representation (DENSER): a general-purpose NeuroEvolution (NE) approach that combines the principles of Genetic Algorithms with Grammatical Evolution; to adapt DENSER to optimise networks of different structures, or to solve various problems the user only needs to change the grammar that is specified in a text human-readable format. The new method, Fast DENSER (F-DENSER), speeds up DENSER, and adds another representation-level that allows the connectivity of the layers to be evolved. The results demonstrate that F-DENSER has a speedup of 20 times when compared to the time DENSER takes to find the best solutions. Concerning the effectiveness of the approach, the results are highly competitive with the state-of-the-art, with the best performing network reporting an average test accuracy of 91.46% on CIFAR-10. This is particularly remarkable since the reduction in the running time does not compromise the performance of the generated solutions. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Automatic Machine Learning; Convolutional Neural Networks; NeuroEvolution","Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Learning systems; Neural networks; Topology; Automatic machines; Computational resources; Convolutional neural network; Evolutionary network; Grammatical evolution; Neuro evolutions; Numerical parameters; Trial-and-error process; Learning algorithms","Assunção, F., Lourenço, N., Machado, P., Ribeiro, B., Evolving the topology of large scale deep neural networks (2018) Genetic Programming, pp. 19-34. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-77553-12, Castelli, M., Sekanina, L., Zhang, M., Cagnoni, S., García-Sánchez, P.

However, developing a ML project entails the effort of many ML experts who have to select and configure the appropriate algorithm to process the data to learn from, between other things. Since there exist thousands of algorithms, it becomes a time-consuming and challenging task. To this end, recently, AutoML emerged to provide mechanisms to automate parts of this process. However, most of the efforts focus on applying brute force procedures to try different algorithms or configuration and select the one which gives better results. To make a smarter and more efficient selection, a repository of knowledge is necessary. To this end, this paper proposes (1) an approach towards a common language to consolidate the current distributed knowledge sources related the algorithm selection in ML, and (2) a method to join the knowledge gathered through this language in a unified store that can be exploited later on. The preliminary evaluations of this approach allow to create a unified store colle lines to conduct. Copyright © 2019 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

However, many of the skip connections in DenseNet are redundant, which may lead to huge consumption of computational resources and computing time. In this paper, we propose an automatic model compression method based on reinforcement learning to prune redundant skip connections in DenseNet and improve its performance. We call the proposed method automatic DenseNet sparsification (ADS). ADS can be implemented with remarkable efficiency, for a 40-layer DenseNet, only running on 1 single GPU and taking less than 1 day. Experimental results on image classification tasks show that, the sparsified DenseNet outperforms not only the original DenseNet, but also related state-of-the-art deep architectures. Moreover, the sparsified DenseNet has strong transferability to new image classification tasks. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Automatic model compression; Reinforcement learning; Sparsified DenseNet; Transferability","Convolution; Deep neural networks; Efficiency; Image classification; Machine learning; Multilayer neural networks; Automatic modeling; Computational resources; Convolutional neural network; Deep architectures; Learning efficiency; Sparsified DenseNet; State of the art; Transferability; Reinforcement learning","Ashok, A., Rhinehart, N., Beainy, F., Kitani, K.M., N2N learning: Network to network compression via policy gradient reinforcement learning (2018) ICLR; Cai, H., Chen, T., Zhang, W., Yu, Y., Wang, J., Efficient architecture search by network transformation (2018) AAAI; Chen, W., Wilson, J.T., Tyree, S., Weinberger, K.Q., Chen, Y., Compressing neural networks with the hashing trick (2015) ICML; Darlow, L.N., Crowley, E.J., Antoniou, A., Storkey, A.J., (2018) CINIC-10 is Not Imagenet Or CIFAR-10, , CoRR abs/1810.03505; Denton, E.L., Zaremba, W., Bruna, J., Lecun, Y., Fergus, R., Exploiting linear structure within convolutional networks for efficient evaluation (2014) Neurips; Han, S., Pool, J., Tran, J., Dally, W.J., Learning both weights and connections for efficient neural network (2015) Neurips; He, K., Zhang, X., Ren, S., Sun, J., Deep residual learning for image recognition (2016) CVPR; He, Y., Lin, J., Liu, Z., Wang, H., Li, L.-J., Han, S., AMC: AutoML for model compression and acceleration on mobile devices (2018) ECCV 2018.

Results indicate that predicting fluid intelligence from volume measurements is a challenging task with many challenges.

Our NAS framework searches the structure of each layer including neural connectivities and operation types in both of the encoder and decoder. Since optimizing over a large discrete architecture space is difficult due to high-resolution 3D medical images, a novel stochastic sampling algorithm based on a continuous relaxation is also proposed for scalable gradient based optimization. On the 3D medical image segmentation tasks with a benchmark dataset, an automatically designed architecture by the proposed NAS framework outperforms the human-designed 3D U-Net, and moreover this optimized architecture is well suited to be transferred for different tasks. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","AutoML; Medical image segmentation; Neural architecture search","Image segmentation; Medical computing; Medical imaging; Stochastic systems; 3D medical image; AutoML; Benchmark datasets; Continuous relaxation; Gradient-based optimization; Neural architectures; Optimized architectures; Stochastic sampling; Medical image processing","Çiçek, Ö., Abdulkadir, A., Lienkamp, S.S., Brox, T., Ronneberger, O., 3D U-Net: Learning dense volumetric segmentation from sparse annotation (2016) MICCAI 2016.

In the case that the function to be learned is multi-valued (so that there are several correct output values for a given input) the problem becomes ill-posed, and many standard methods fail to find good solutions. However, optimisation problems based on multi-valued functions are relatively common. They include reverse robot kinematics, and the research field of AutoML – which is becoming increasingly popular – where one seeks to establish optimal hyperparameters for a learning algorithm for a particular problem based on loss function values for trained networks, or to reuse training from previous networks. We present an analysis of this problem, together with an approach based on k-nearest neighbours, which we demonstrate on a set of simple examples, including two application areas of interest. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","AutoML; Ill-posed optimisation; Local models; Multi-valued functions","Learning algorithms; Nearest neighbor search; Vector spaces; AutoML; Input and outputs; K-nearest neighbours; Learning approach; Local model; Multivalued functions; Optimisation problems; Optimisations; Data mining","Brouwer, R.K., Feed-forward neural network for one-to-many mappings using fuzzy sets (2004) Neurocomputing, 57, pp. 345-360; Butterfield, J., Osentoski, S., Jay, G., Jenkins, O.C., Learning from demonstration using a multi-valued function regressor for time-series data (2010) 2010 10Th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots (Humanoids), pp. 328-333. , pp., IEEE; Damas, B., Santos-Victor, J., Online learning of single-and multivalued functions with an infinite mixture of linear experts (2013) Neural Comput, 25 (11), pp. 3044-3091; Ester, M., Kriegel, H.P., Sander, J., Xu, X., A density-based algorithm for discovering clusters in large spatial databases with noise (1996) Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 226-231. , pp; Goldman, S.A., Rivest, R.L., Schapire, R.E., Learning binary relations and total orders (1993) SIAM J.

Many published works apply reinforcement learning or evolutionary algorithm to design the neural architecture for image classification and achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, using NAS to perform other challenging tasks, such as inpainting irregular regions in an image, has not been explored yet. The target of image inpainting is to generate plausible image regions to fill the missing regions in the original image. It has been widely used in many applications. In this paper, we are interested in applying neural architecture search methods to image inpainting tasks. We propose to use reinforcement learning to automatically design the network architecture. Our method can efficiently explore new network structure based on existing architecture. The experiment result demonstrates that the proposed method can design an efficient and high-quality architecture for image inpainting. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","AutoML; Image inpainting; Neural architecture search; Partial convolution; Reinforcement learning; U-Net","Image processing; Machine learning; Reinforcement learning; Architecture engineering; AutoML; Existing architectures; Image Inpainting; Network structures; Neural architectures; Original images; State-of-the-art performance; Network architecture","Angeline, P.J., Saunders, G.M., Pollack, J.B., An evolutionary algorithm that constructs recurrent neural networks (1994) IEEE Trans.

However, there are only a few NAS methods suitable for 3D medical image segmentation. Medical 3D images are generally very large; thus it is difficult to apply previous NAS methods due to their GPU computational burden and long training time. We propose the resource-optimized neural architecture search method which can be applied to 3D medical segmentation tasks in a short training time (1.39 days for 1 GB dataset) using a small amount of computation power (one RTX 2080Ti, 10.8 GB GPU memory). Excellent performance can also be achieved without retraining (fine-tuning) which is essential in most NAS methods. These advantages can be achieved by using a reinforcement learning-based controller with parameter sharing and focusing on the optimal search space configuration of macro search rather than micro search. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed NAS method outperforms manually designed networks with state-of-the-art performance in 3D medical image segmentation. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","3D medical image segmentation; AutoML; Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN); Neural Architecture Search (NAS)","Deep learning; Image segmentation; Medical computing; Network architecture; Neural networks; Reinforcement learning; 3D medical image; AutoML; Computation power; Computational burden; Convolutional neural network; Medical segmentations; Neural architectures; State-of-the-art performance; Medical image processing","Bender, G., Kindermans, P.J., Zoph, B., Vasudevan, V., Le, Q., Understanding and simplifying one-shot architecture search (2018) International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 549-558. , pp; Chen, L.-C., Zhu, Y., Papandreou, G., Schroff, F., Adam, H., Encoder-decoder with atrous separable convolution for semantic image segmentation (2018) ECCV 2018.

The experiments are carried out using deep learning techniques and for that we have proposed a Convolutional Siamese Network (CNN-Siamese) and a multiscale Convolutional Siamese network (MCNN-Siamese). We have also explored and evaluated three pre-trained CNNs namely, ResNet-50, VGG-16 and NASNet-Large, and utilized them in Siamese network after appropriate modifications. In addition, a simple 5-layer neural network (sNN) is also utilised as Siamese subnetwork in the experiments. We have presented compelling experimental evidences in terms of correct classification accuracy (CCR) on CASIA-IrisV4 Twins’ dataset that manifest the effectiveness of ocular biometrics in identifying twins. The results achieve the existing state-of-the-art human level accuracy. Also, the proximity of CCRs of all the models asserts that the ocular regions in twins hold a significant correlation to label them as twins. We have also quantified the cross-domain capability of the proposed subnetworks (i.e. CNN and MCNN) on ND-GFI dataset that outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Notably, for the ocular biometrics, to the best of our knowledge, there is currently no literature available as of date that explores the association between twins and subsequently unriddles the classification using Deep Learning. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","AutoML; Convolutional neural network; Multiscale convolutional neural network; Ocular biometric features; Siamese network; Transfer learning","Biometrics; Classification (of information); Convolution; Neural networks; AutoML; Biometric authentication; Biometric features; Classification accuracy; Convolutional neural network; Identification problem; State-of-the-art methods; Transfer learning; Deep learning","Al Ghamdi, M., Li, M., Abdel-Mottaleb, M., Shousha, M.A., Semi-supervised transfer learning for convolutional neural networks for glaucoma detection (2019) ICASSP 2019-2019 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP).

Since the number of ML applications is growing, there is a need for tools that boost the data scientist's productivity. Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) is the field of ML that aims to address these needs through the development of solutions which enable data science practitioners, experts and non-experts, to efficiently create fine-tuned predictive models with minimum intervention. In this paper, we present the application of the multi-armed bandit optimization algorithm Hyperband to address the AutoML problem of generating customized classification workflows, a combination of preprocessing methods and ML algorithms including hyperparameter optimization. Experimental results comparing the bandit-based approach against Auto ML Bayesian Optimization methods show that this new approach is superior to the state-of-the-art methods in the test evaluation and equivalent to them in a statistical analysis. © 2018 IEEE.","autoband; automl; machine learning; workflow selection","Intelligent systems; Learning systems; Statistical tests; autoband; automl; Bayesian optimization; Hyper-parameter optimizations; Minimum interventions; Optimization algorithms; State-of-the-art methods; workflow selection; Machine learning","Fayyad, U., Piatetsky-Shapiro, G., Smyth, P., From data mining toknowledge discovery in databases (1996) AI Magazine, 17 (3), p. 37; De Sa, A.G., Pinto, W.J.G., Oliveira, L.O.V., Pappa, G.L., Recipe: A grammar-based framework for automatically evolving classificationpipelines (2017) European Conference on Genetic Programming, pp. 246-261. , Springer; Guyon, I., Bennett, K., Cawley, G., Escalante, H.J., Escalera, S., Ho, T.K., MacIa, N., Statnikov, A., Design of the2015 chalearn automl challenge (2015) Neural Networks (IJCNN), 2015International Joint Conference on, pp. 1-8. , IEEE; Salvador, M.M., Budka, M., Gabrys, B., (2016) Automatic Compositionand Optimisation of Multicomponent Predictive Systems; Li, L., Jamieson, K., DeSalvo, G., Rostamizadeh, A., Talwalkar, A., (2016) Hyperband: A Novel Bandit-based Approach to Hyperparameter Optimization; Witten, I.H., Frank, E., Hall, M.A., Pal, C.J., (2016) Data Mining: Practicalmachine Learning Tools and Techniques, , Morgan Kaufmann; Thornton, C., Hutter, F., Hoos, H.H., Leyton-Brown, K., Auto-weka:Combined selection and hyperparameter optimization of classificationalgorithms (2013) Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD Internationalconference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 847-855. , ACM; Feurer, M., Klein, A., Eggensperger, K., Springenberg, J., Blum, M., Hutter, F., Efficient and robust automated machine learning (2015) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 2962-2970; Hutter, F., Hoos, H.H., Leyton-Brown, K., Sequential model-basedoptimization for general algorithm configuration (2011) LION, 5, pp. 507-523; Kotthoff, L., Thornton, C., Hoos, H.H., Hutter, F., Leyton-Brown, K., Auto-weka 2.0: Automatic model selection and hyperparameteroptimization in weka (2016) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 17, pp. 1-5; Pedregosa, F., Varoquaux, G., Gramfort, A., Michel, V., Thirion, B., Grisel, O., Blondel, M., Duchesnay, E., Scikit-learn: Machine learning in Python (2011) Journal of MachineLearning Research, 12, pp. 2825-2830; Jamieson, K., Talwalkar, A., Non-stochastic best arm identificationand hyperparameter optimization (2016) Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, pp. 240-248; Tang, J., Alelyani, S., Liu, H., Feature selection for classification: Areview (2014) Data Classification: Algorithms and Applications, p. 37; Yang, Q., Wu, X., 10 challenging problems in data mining research (2006) International Journal of Information Technology & Decision Making, 5 (4), pp. 597-604; Parmezan, A.R.S., Lee, H.D., Wu, F.C., Metalearning forchoosing feature selection algorithms in data mining: Proposal of a newframework (2017) Expert Systems with Applications, 75, pp. 1-24; Asuncion, A., Newman, D., (2007) Uci Machine Learning Repository; Bergstra, J., Bengio, Y., Random search for hyper-parameter optimization (2012) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 13, pp. 281-305. , Feb; (2009) Kdd Cup 2009: Customer Relationship Prediction; Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., (2009) Learning Multiple Layers of Features Fromtiny Images; Demsar, J., Statistical comparisons of classifiers over multiple data sets (2006) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 7, pp. 1-30. , Jan","Proc. - Braz.

Current practice considers referring patients for LT evaluation once the forced expiratory volume (FEV1) drops below 30% of its predicted nominal value. While FEV1 is indeed a strong predictor of CF-related mortality, we hypothesized that the survival behavior of CF patients exhibits a lot more heterogeneity. To this end, we developed an algorithmic framework, which we call AutoPrognosis, that leverages the power of machine learning to automate the process of constructing clinical prognostic models, and used it to build a prognostic model for CF using data from a contemporary cohort that involved 99% of the CF population in the UK. AutoPrognosis uses Bayesian optimization techniques to automate the process of configuring ensembles of machine learning pipelines, which involve imputation, feature processing, classification and calibration algorithms. Because it is automated, it can be used by clinical researchers to build prognostic models without the need for in-depth knowledge of machine learning. Our experiments revealed that the accuracy of the model learned by AutoPrognosis is superior to that of existing guidelines and other competing models. © 2018, The Author(s).",,"biological marker; automation; complication; cystic fibrosis; human; lung function test; machine learning; mortality; pathology; prognosis; respiratory failure; risk factor; survival analysis; United Kingdom; Automation; Biomarkers; Cystic Fibrosis; Humans; Machine Learning; Prognosis; Respiratory Function Tests; Respiratory Insufficiency; Risk Factors; Survival Analysis; United Kingdom","Adler, A.I., Shine, B.S., Chamnan, P., Haworth, C.S., Bilton, D., Genetic determinants and epidemiology of cystic fibrosis–related diabetes (2008) Diabetes care, 31, pp. 1789-1794. , PID: 18535191; Fanen, P., Wohlhuter-Haddad, A., Hinzpeter, A., Genetics of cystic fibrosis: Cftr mutation classifications toward genotype-based cf therapies (2014) The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology, 52, pp. 94-102; Mogayzel, P.J., Jr., Cystic fibrosis foundation pulmonary guideline*.

Experimental confirmation of all possible links is difficult and generates a huge volume of information. Consequently, computational prediction becomes an important goal. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are Machine Learning (ML) algorithms that may be used to predict BENs, using as input Shannon entropy information measures (Shk) of known ecosystems to train them. However, it is difficult to select a priori which ANN topology will have a higher accuracy. Interestingly, Auto Machine Learning (AutoML) methods focus on the automatic selection of the more efficient ML algorithms for specific problems. In this work, a preliminary study of a new approach to AutoML selection of ANNs is proposed for the prediction of BENs. We call it the Net-Net AutoML approach, because it uses for the first time Shk values of both networks involving BENs (networks to be predicted) and ANN topologies (networks to be tested). Twelve types of classifiers have been tested for the Net-Net model including linear, Bayesian, trees-based methods, multilayer perceptrons and deep neuronal networks. The best Net-Net AutoML model for 338,050 outputs of 10 ANN topologies for links of 69 BENs was obtained with a deep fully connected neuronal network, characterized by a test accuracy of 0.866 and a test AUROC of 0.935. This work paves the way for the application of Net-Net AutoML to other systems or ML algorithms. © 2018, The Author(s).",,"article; classifier; ecosystem; entropy; multilayer perceptron; nerve cell network; prediction; receiver operating characteristic","Sandhu, K.S., Large-scale functional organization of long-range chromatin interaction networks (2012) Cell Rep, 2, pp. 1207-1219; Gaspar, M.E., Csermely, P., Rigidity and flexibility of biological networks (2012) Brief Funct Genomics, 11, pp. 443-456; Csermely, P., Korcsmaros, T., Kiss, H.J., London, G., Nussinov, R., Structure and dynamics of molecular networks: A novel paradigm of drug discovery: A comprehensive review (2013) Pharmacol.

The forward FEM simulations of cardiac ischemia in different heart segments enabled the creation of a virtual database which consisted of corresponding body surface potentials. Two sets of experiments were performed on the database in order to select the best method for determining the existence of ischemia and then to predict the location of ischemia. Using Auto-WEKA and R caret package, several machine learning algorithms were tested. The best first phase model returned the classification accuracy of 95.3%, while the best second phase model determined the correct ischemia location with 95% accuracy. Considerable modeling and computational time are needed to create a training database and perform training, but once trained, the models will instantly return results. Thus, the main advantage of the proposed approach to ischemic detection and localization is a real-time availability of results and a novel, two-phase design which guides the selection of an adequate treatment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Automatic model selection; Cardiac ischemia; Data mining; Finite element modeling","Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Database systems; Heart; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Automated machines; Automatic model selection; Body surface potentials; Cardiac ischemia; Classification accuracy; Computational time; Detection and localization; Machine learning approaches; Finite element method","Thygesen, K., Alpert, J.S., Jaffe, A.S., Simoons, M.L., Chaitman, B.R., White, H.D., Third universal definition of myocardial infarction (2012) Circulation, 26 (16), pp. 2020-2035; Cluitmans, M.J., Peeters, R.L., Westra, R.L., Volders, P.G., Noninvasive reconstruction of cardiac electrical activity: update on current methods, applications and challenges (2015) Neth.

It is a knowledge intensive process that relies heavily on well-trained or experienced employees. Recently, automated customer service is emerging. It can help organizations reduce operation and training costs. They apply machine learning to big data to provide automated or semi-automated customer service. However, most startups or small and medium enterprises do not have sufficient data and knowledge. As a result, they still rely on customer service personnel or use automated customer service provided by third parties. Therefore, it is difficult for them to develop their own core customer service competency. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based AutoML framework that aims to provide an open environment for data trading. The architecture, dataflow, and key elements are presented and discussed. The framework not only helps organizations that do not have sufficient training data and knowledge to provide automated customer services, but also maintains continuous updates and learning in a reduced cost and risk. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

However, deep neural networks are useful methods but usually require a proper modeling to construct a deep neural network method in any application. Designing a model is a tedious task to be realized in the network, which opens an issue to design an effective software tool for modeling deep neural networks. To get an excellent model for deep neural networks, the developers should have sufficient understanding and experience for deep neural network methods. The developers also require coding skills with the deep learning frameworks and knowledge for the computing resources. This paper presents a software tool based on a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to develop deep neural network models, which train the models with external computing resources and automate the hyper-parameter tuning. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Automated machine learning; Deep learning and convolutional neural networks; Machine learning","Automatic programming; Computer software; Graphical user interfaces; Learning systems; Neural networks; Automated machines; Computing resource; Convolutional neural network; Graphical user interfaces (GUI); Health care application; Learning frameworks; Neural network method; Neural network model; Deep neural networks","Martín, A., TensorFlow: A System for Large-Scale Machine Learning (2016) Operating Systems Design and Implementation, 16, pp. 265-283; Yangqing, J., Caffe: Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding (2014) Proceedings of the 22nd ACM International Conference on Multimedia, pp. 675-678; https://keras.io/, (accessed on April, 05, 2018); Smith, T.C., Frank, E., (2016) Statistical Genomics: Methods and Protocols, pp. 353-378. , New York NY: Springer, ch.

However, knowledge in machine learning and technical skill are usually required to prepare data and perform machine learning tasks. This obstacle prevents smaller businesses with no technical knowledge to utilize machine learning. In this paper, we propose an architecture for simplified and automated machine learning process currently supporting the data classification task. The architecture includes a method for characterizing datasets, which allows for simplifying and automating machine learning model and hyperparameter selection based on historical execution configurations. Users can simply upload their datasets via a web browser, and the system will determine the possible models and their hyperparameter configurations for the users to choose from. The prototype shows the feasibility of the proposed architecture. Although the accuracy is still limited by the small execution history and the cleanliness of the input datasets, the architecture can minimize user involvement in the machine learning process so that non-technical users can perform data classification through a web browser without installing any software. © 2018 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Although many search methods have been applied to approach this problem, swarm intelligence algorithms, largely used in model selection tasks with low computational cost, have not yet been considered in a hierarchical manner. Therefore, this work proposes Hierarchical Ant Colony Model Builder (HACOMB), a modification of the Ant Colony Optimization for mixed-variables (ACOMV) algorithm that enables it to tackle the hierarchical search space of the AutoML problem for classification tasks. The proposed method was evaluated in the job of selecting SVM kernels and optimizing its hyperparameters. Results of HACOMB on a suite of benchmark datasets show that the method is much faster, while as accurate as or better when compared to a naive approach to the problem. © 2018 IEEE.","ant colony optimization; automated machine learning; classification; hierarchy","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Evolutionary algorithms; Learning systems; Automated machines; Classification tasks; Classifier selection; Computational costs; Hierarchical search; hierarchy; Hyper-parameter optimizations; Swarm intelligence algorithms; Ant colony optimization","Wolpert, D.H., The lack of a priori distinctions between learning algorithms (1996) Neural Computation, 8 (7), pp. 1341-1390. , Oct; Bergstra, J., Bengio, Y., Random search for hyper-parameter optimization (2012) J.

The most general version of this problem is pipeline optimization, which seeks an optimal combination of preprocessors and classifiers, along with their respective parameters. In this paper we address the pipeline generation problem from a broader perspective, that of problem complexity understanding as a previous step before proposing a solution, a comprehension we consider critical. The main contribution of this work is the analysis of the characteristics of the fitness landscape. Furthermore, a recently introduced tool for pipeline generation is used to investigate how an automatic method behaves in the previously studied landscape. Results show the high complexity of the pipeline optimization problem, as it can contain several disperse optima, and suffers from a severe lack of generality. Results also suggest that, depending on the dimensions of the search, the model quality target, and the data being modeled, basic search methods can produce results that match the user's expectations. © 2018 IEEE.","automated machine learning; genetic programming; supervised classification","Artificial intelligence; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Pipelines; Supervised learning; Automated machines; Automatic method; Fitness landscape; General version; Optimal combination; Pipeline optimization; Problem complexity; Supervised classification; Learning algorithms","Thornton, C., Hutter, F., Hoos, H.H., Leyton-Brown, K., Auto-weka: Combined selection and hyperparameter optimization of classification algorithms (2013) Ser.

Although current approaches to AutoML have already produced impressive results, the field is still far from mature, and new techniques are still being developed. In this paper, we present ML-Plan, a new approach to AutoML based on hierarchical planning. To highlight the potential of this approach, we compare ML-Plan to the state-of-the-art frameworks Auto-WEKA, auto-sklearn, and TPOT. In an extensive series of experiments, we show that ML-Plan is highly competitive and often outperforms existing approaches. © 2018, The Author(s).","Algorithm configuration; Algorithm selection; Automated machine learning; Automated planning; Heuristic search","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Heuristic algorithms; Learning systems; Algorithm configurations; Algorithm selection; Automated machines; Automated planning; Heuristic search; Learning algorithms","Bjornsson, Y., Finnsson, H., Cadiaplayer: A simulation-based general game player (2009) IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, 1 (1), pp. 4-15; Browne, C., Powley, E.J., Whitehouse, D., Lucas, S.M., Cowling, P.I., Rohlfshagen, P., Tavener, S., Colton, S., A survey of monte carlo tree search methods (2012) IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, 4 (1), pp. 1-43; Sá, A.G., Pinto, W.J.G., Oliveira, L.O.V., Pappa, G.L., Recipe: A grammar-based framework for automatically evolving classification pipelines (2017) In European Conference on Genetic Programming, pp. 246-261. , Springer; Erol, K., Hendler, J.A., Nau, D.S., UMCP: A sound and complete procedure for hierarchical task-network planning (1994) Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Planning Systems, 1994, pp. 249-254. , http://www.aaai.org/Library/AIPS/1994/aips94-042.php, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA, June 13–15; Feurer, M., Klein, A., Eggensperger, K., Springenberg, J., Blum, M., Hutter, F., Efficient and robust automated machine learning (2015) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 2962-2970. , In C.

Multiple vendor software programs have incorporated automation to improve accuracy and efficiency of manual tracings. Automation with longitudinal strain and 3D echocardiography has shown great accuracy and reproducibility allowing the incorporation of these techniques into daily workflow. This will give further experience to nonexpert readers and allow the integration of these essential tools into more echocardiography laboratories. The potential for machine learning in cardiovascular imaging is still being discovered as algorithms are being created, with training on large data sets beyond what traditional statistical reasoning can handle. Deep learning when applied to large image repositories will recognize complex relationships and patterns integrating all properties of the image, which will unlock further connections about the natural history and prognosis of cardiac disease states. The purpose of this review article was to describe the role and current use of automation, machine learning, and AI in echocardiography and discuss potential limitations and challenges of in the future. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","algorithm;

However, materials research often involves long timelines and low success probabilities, dissuading investors who have expectations of shorter times from bench to business. A combination of emergent technologies could accelerate the pace of novel materials development by ten times or more, aligning the timelines of stakeholders (investors and researchers), markets, and the environment, while increasing return on investment. First, tool automation enables rapid experimental testing of candidate materials. Second, high-performance computing concentrates experimental bandwidth on promising compounds by predicting and inferring bulk, interface, and defect-related properties. Third, machine learning connects the former two, where experimental outputs automatically refine theory and help define next experiments. We describe state-of-the-art attempts to realize this vision and identify resource gaps. We posit that over the coming decade, this combination of tools will transform the way we perform materials research, with considerable first-mover advantages at stake. The convergence of high-performance computing, automation, and machine learning promises to accelerate the rate of materials discovery by ≥10 times, better aligning investor and stakeholder timelines. Infrastructure and human-capital investments are discussed, including equipment capabilities, data management, education, and incentives. As our field transitions from thinking “data poor” to thinking “data rich,” we envision a scientific laboratory where the process of materials discovery continues without disruptions, aided by computational power augmenting the human mind, and freeing the latter to perform research closer to the speed of imagination, addressing societal challenges in market-relevant timeframes. A combination of emergent technologies promises to accelerate novel materials development by ten times or more: tool automation, high-performance computing, and machine learning. We describe state-of-the-art attempts to realize this vision and identify resource gaps, including required infrastructure and human-capital investments. © 2018","accelerated materials development; artificial intelligence; energy materials; machine learning","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Commerce; Computation theory; Economic and social effects; Information management; Learning systems; Personnel; Energy materials; First mover advantages; High performance computing; Human capital investments; Materials development; Materials innovations; Return on investments; Success probabilities; Investments; automation; machine learning; product development; stakeholder; technological development","Gaddy, B.E., Sivaram, V., Jones, T.B., Wayman, L., Venture capital and cleantech: the wrong model for energy innovation (2017) Energy Policy, 102, pp. 385-395; Aspuru-Guzik, A., Persson, K., (2018), http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:35164974, Materials acceleration platform: accelerating advanced energy materials discovery by integrating high-throughput methods and artificial intelligence.

For example, if a data scientist performs an analysis in 2017 that saves a significant amount of money, then she will likely to be asked to perform the same analysis on data from 2018. But more data analyses means more effort spent in data wrangling. We introduce the data diff problem, which attempts to turn this problem into an opportunity. Comparing the repeated data samples against each other, inconsistencies may be indicative of underlying issues in data quality. By analogy to text diff, the data diff problem is to find a “patch”, that is, transformation in a specified domain-specific language, that transforms the data samples so that they are identically distributed. We present a prototype tool for data diff that formalizes the problem as a bipartite matching problem, calibrating its parameters using a bootstrap procedure. The tool is evaluated quantitatively and through a case study on an open government data set. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Automl; Data mining; Data wrangling; Sequential analysis","Data mining; Problem oriented languages; Statistical methods; Automl; Bipartite matching problems; Data quality; Data wrangling; Domain specific languages; Multiple data; Prototype tools; Sequential analysis; Metadata","Abedjan, Z., Chu, X., Deng, D., Fernandez, R.C., Ilyas, I.F., Ouzzani, M., Papotti, P., Tang, N., Detecting data errors: Where are we and what needs to be done?

Despite suicide prevention strategies being applied, the rate of suicide has not changed substantially over the past decades. Advances in machine learning make it possible to attempt to predict suicide based on the analysis of relevant data to inform clinical practice. This paper reports on findings from the analysis of data of patients who died by suicide in the period 2013-2016 and made use of both structured data and free-text medical notes. We focus on examining various text-mining approaches to support risk assessment. The results show that using advance machine learning and text-mining techniques, it is possible to predict within a specified period which people are most at risk of taking their own life at the time of referral to a mental health service. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Automated machine learning;

Autostacker combines an innovative hierarchical stacking architecture and an evolutionary algorithm (EA) to perform efficient parameter search without the need for prior domain knowledge about the data or feature preprocessing. Using EA, Autostacker quickly evolves candidate pipelines with high predictive accuracy. These pipelines can be used in their given form, or serve as a starting point for further augmentation and refinement by human experts. Autostacker finds innovative machine learning model combinations and structures, rather than selecting a single model and optimizing its hyperparameters. When its performance on fifteen datasets is compared with that of other AutoML systems, Autostacker produces superior or competitive results in terms of both test accuracy and time cost. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","AutoML; Evolutionary machine learning; Machine learning","Artificial intelligence; Evolutionary algorithms; Pipelines; Automatic machines; AutoML; Domain knowledge; Evolutionary Learning; Machine learning models; Model architecture; Predictive accuracy; Stacking architecture; Learning systems","Bergstra, J., Yamins, D., Cox, D.D., Hyperopt: A python library for optimizing the hyperparameters of machine learning algorithms (2013) Proceedings of The 12th Python in Science Conference, pp. 13-20; Breiman, L., Stacked regressions (1996) Machine Learning, 24 (1), pp. 49-64. , 1996; Caruana, R., Niculescu-Mizil, A., Crew, G., Ksikes, A., Ensemble selection from libraries of models (2004) Proceedings of The Twenty-First International Conference on Machine Learning, p. 18; Chen, T., Guestrin, C., (2016) XGBoost: A Scalable Tree Boosting System, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02754, CoRR abs/1603.02754 2016; Cortes, C., Vapnik, V., Support-vector networks (1995) Machine Learning, 20 (3), pp. 273-297. , 1995; Eiben, A.E., Smith, J.E., (2003) Introduction to Evolutionary Computing, 53. , Springer; Feurer, M., Klein, A., Eggensperger, K., Springenberg, J., Blum, M., Hutter, F., Efficient and robust automated machine learning (2015) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 2962-2970; Freund, Y., Boosting a weak learning algorithm by majority (1995) Information and Computation, 121 (2), pp. 256-285. , 1995; H2O-3, , https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3, n. d. n. d; Hall, M., Frank, E., Holmes, G., Pfahringer, B., Reutemann, P., Witten, I.H., The WEKA data mining software: An update (2009) ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter, 11 (1), pp. 10-18. , 2009; Heitz, G., Gould, S., Saxena, A., Koller, D., Cascaded classification models: Combining models for holistic scene understanding (2009) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 641-648; Hutter, F., Hoos, H.H., Leyton-Brown, K., Sequential model-based optimization for general algorithm configuration (2011) LION, 5, pp. 507-523. , 2011; Kearns, M., (1988) Learning Boolean Formulae or Finite Automata Is as Hard as Factoring, , Technical Harvard University Aikem Computation Laboratory 1988; Kotthoff, L., Thornton, C., Hoos, H.H., Hutter, F., Leyton-Brown, K., Auto-WEKA 2.0: Automatic model selection and hyperparameter optimization in WEKA (2016) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 17, pp. 1-5. , 2016; LeCun, Y., Bengio, Y., Hinton, G., Deep learning (2015) Nature, 521 (7553), p. 436. , 2015; Lichman, M., (2013) UCI Machine Learning Repository, , http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml, 2013; Lloyd, J., (2015) Freeze Thaw Ensemble Construction, , https://github.com/jamesrobertlloyd/automl-phase-2, 2015; Morse, G., Stanley, K.O., Simple evolutionary optimization can rival stochastic gradient descent in neural networks (2016) Proceedings of The Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference 2016 (GECCO'16), pp. 477-484. , https://doi.org/10.1145/2908812.2908916, ACM, New York, NY, USA; Olson, R.S., Bartley, N., Urbanowicz, R.J., Moore, J.H., Evaluation of a tree-based pipeline optimization tool for automating data science (2016) Proceedings of The Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference 2016 (GECCO'16), pp. 485-492. , https://doi.org/10.1145/2908812.2908918, ACM, New York, NY, USA; Olson, R.S., Cava, W.L., Orzechowski, P., Urbanowicz, R.J., Moore, J.H., (2017) PMLB: A Large Benchmark Suite for Machine Learning Evaluation and Comparison, , arXiv preprint 2017; Olson, R.S., Urbanowicz, R.J., Andrews, P.C., Lavender, N.A., Moore, J.H., Automating biomedical data science through tree-based pipeline optimization (2016) European Conference on The Applications of Evolutionary Computation, pp. 123-137. , Springer; Opitz, D.W., Maclin, R., Popular ensemble methods: An empirical study (1999) J.

Text Classification (TC) has become one of the key techniques for controlling and organizing documents based on the content of documents. Therefore, keyword extraction is one of the most important natural language processing applications, which extracts information from the document such as term collocations, which are two or more words appear together and always seem as associated. In Arabic language, there are many problems in keyword extraction because of the complexity of Arabic orthography. Moreover, the accuracy is affecting by the document content and the classification technique used. The need for automatic text classification came from a large amount of electronic documents on the web. This research aims to propose an Automatic Machine Learning Techniques (AMLT) for classifying Arabic documents by using term collocations. These collocations are mined from Arabic documents, the extracted term collocations will scoring by using association measure and will be used as terms feature selection. To achieve this study, we used Arabic documents divided into four categories (Economy/ business, Politics, Religion and Science). The results of our approach have compared with the full-document approach and summary-document approach using four techniques (SVM, NB, J48, and KNN) for Arabic documents to determine which classifier is more accurate for Arabic text based on term collocation. The evaluation results proved that our proposed approach outperforms the other method in accuracy. © 2005 - ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Arabic language; Bi-gram; Category; Machine learning; Term collocations; Text classification",,"Saif, A.M., Aziz, M.J.A., An Automatic Collocation Extraction from Arabic Corpus (2011) Journal of Computer Science, 7 (1), pp. 6-11; An Experimental Study for the Effect of Stop Words Elimination for Arabic Text Classification Algorithms (2011) International Journal of Information Technology and Web Engineering (IJITWE), 6 (2), pp. 68-75. , April-June; Al-Saleem, S., Automated Arabic Text Categorization Using SVM and NB (2011) International Arab Journal of E-Technology, 2 (2). , June; Beal, V., (2011) Search Engine, , www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/search_engine.html, accessed April 2015); Shaalan, K., Oudah, M., A hybrid approach to Arabic named entity recognition (2014) Journal of Information Science (JIS), 40, pp. 67-87; www.internetworldstats.com/stats5.htm, Available at, (accessed May 2017); Al-Zoghby, A., Sharaf, A., Hamza, T., Arabic Semantic Web Applications–A Survey (2013) Journal of Emerging Technologies in Web Intelligence (JETWI), 5, pp. 52-69; Al-Shalabi, R., Obeidat, R., (2008) Improving KNN Arabic text classification with n-grams based document indexing.

Existing risk adjustment algorithms are not widely adopted. Key barriers to adoption include licensing and implementation costs as well as labor costs associated with human-intensive data collection. Widespread adoption of electronic health records makes automated risk adjustment feasible. Using modern machine learning methods and open source tools, we developed and evaluated a retrospective risk adjustment algorithm for in-hospital mortality among ICU patients. The Risk of Inpatient Death score can be fully automated and is reliant upon data elements that are generated in the course of usual hospital processes. SETTING: One hundred thirty-one ICUs in 53 hospitals operated by Tenet Healthcare. PATIENTS: A cohort of 237,173 ICU patients discharged between January 2014 and December 2016. DESIGN: The data were randomly split into training (36 hospitals), and validation (17 hospitals) data sets. Feature selection and model training were carried out using the training set while the discrimination, calibration, and accuracy of the model were assessed in the validation data set. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Model discrimination was evaluated based on the area under receiver operating characteristic curve; accuracy and calibration were assessed via adjusted Brier scores and visual analysis of calibration curves. Seventeen features, including a mix of clinical and administrative data elements, were retained in the final model. The Risk of Inpatient Death score demonstrated excellent discrimination (area under receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.94) and calibration (adjusted Brier score = 52.8%) in the validation dataset; these results compare favorably to the published performance statistics for the most commonly used mortality risk adjustment algorithms. CONCLUSIONS: Low adoption of ICU mortality risk adjustment algorithms impedes progress toward increasing the value of the healthcare delivered in ICUs. The Risk of Inpatient Death score has many attractive attributes that address the key barriers to adoption of ICU risk adjustment algorithms and performs comparably to existing human-intensive algorithms. Automated risk adjustment algorithms have the potential to obviate known barriers to adoption such as cost-prohibitive licensing fees and significant direct labor costs. Further evaluation is needed to ensure that the level of performance observed in this study could be achieved at independent sites.",,"algorithm; female; hospital mortality; human; intensive care unit; male; middle aged; procedures; risk assessment; statistical model; unsupervised machine learning; Algorithms; Female; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Risk Adjustment; Unsupervised Machine Learning",,"Crit.

In this paper, we present a practical and innovative framework to close this gap. To validate our approach, we carry out detailed simulation studies and real data analyses. The experimental results show that our framework is more robust to data granularity with better accuracy and computational efficiency when comparing with baseline methods.

Moreover, given the ever increasing number of machine learning models being developed, model selection is becoming increasingly important. Automating the selection and tuning of machine learning pipelines, which can include different data pre-processing methods and machine learning models, has long been one of the goals of the machine learning community. In this paper, we propose to solve this meta-learning task by combining ideas from collaborative filtering and Bayesian optimization. Specifically, we use a probabilistic matrix factorization model to transfer knowledge across experiments performed in hundreds of different datasets and use an acquisition function to guide the exploration of the space of possible pipelines. In our experiments, we show that our approach quickly identifies high-performing pipelines across a wide range of datasets, significantly outperforming the current state-of-the-art. © 2018 Curran Associates Inc..All rights reserved.",,"Collaborative filtering;

In this paper, we present a method for the selection of a learning algorithm while simultaneously setting the hyper-parameters in a two-stage process: (1) Identification of important hyper-parameters to streamline the optimization process, and (2) Heuristic formulation based on sequence analysis to limit the long-tuning time and identify the optimal algorithm/ hyper-parameter combination.

Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) approaches provide exciting opportunity to guide feature selection in agnostic metabolic profiling endeavors, where potentially thousands of independent data points must be evaluated. In previous research, AutoML using high-dimensional data of varying types has been demonstrably robust, outperforming traditional approaches. However, considerations for application in clinical metabolic profiling remain to be evaluated. Particularly, regarding the robustness of AutoML to identify and adjust for common clinical confounders. In this study, we present a focused case study regarding AutoML considerations for using the Tree-Based Optimization Tool (TPOT) in metabolic profiling of exposure to metformin in a biobank cohort. First, we propose a tandem rank-accuracy measure to guide agnostic feature selection and corresponding threshold determination in clinical metabolic profiling endeavors. Second, while AutoML, using default parameters, demonstrated potential to lack sensitivity to low-effect confounding clinical covariates, we demonstrated residual training and adjustment of metabolite features as an easily applicable approach to ensure AutoML adjustment for potential confounding characteristics. Finally, we present increased homocysteine with long-term exposure to metformin as a potentially novel, non-replicated metabolite association suggested by TPOT; an association not identified in parallel clinical metabolic profiling endeavors. While warranting independent replication, our tandem rank-accuracy measure suggests homocysteine to be the metabolite feature with largest effect, and corresponding priority for further translational clinical research. Residual training and adjustment for a potential confounding effect by BMI only slightly modified the suggested association. Increased homocysteine is thought to be associated with vitamin B12 deficiency – evaluation for potential clinical relevance is suggested. While considerations for clinical metabolic profiling are recommended, including adjustment approaches for clinical confounders, AutoML presents an exciting tool to enhance clinical metabolic profiling and advance translational research endeavors. © 2017 The Authors.","Automated machine learning; Biobank; Clinical metabolic profiling; Confounding; Homocysteine; Metabolomics; Metformin; Pharmacometabolomics; Precision medicine","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Biomolecules; Clustering algorithms; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Metabolism; Metabolites; Automated machines; Biobank; Confounding; Homocysteines; Metabolic profiling; Metabolomics; Metformins; Pharmacometabolomics; Clinical research; antidiabetic agent; homocysteine; metformin; biology; blood; body mass; case control study; human; metabolome; metabolomics; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; procedures; risk factor; statistical bias; statistics and numerical data; supervised machine learning; translational research; Bias; Body Mass Index; Case-Control Studies; Computational Biology; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Homocysteine; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Metabolome; Metabolomics; Metformin; Risk Factors; Supervised Machine Learning; Translational Medical Research","Collins, F.S., Varmus, H., (2015) N.

Typical examples of this approach include decomposition schemes such as one-vs-rest, all-pairs, and nested dichotomies. While all these techniques produce reductions to purely binary subproblems, which is reasonable when only binary classifiers ought to be used, we argue that reductions to other multi-class problems can be interesting, too. In this paper, we examine a new type of (meta-)classifier called reduction stump. A reduction stump creates a binary split among the given classes, thereby creating two subproblems, each of which is solved by a multi-class classifier in turn. On top, the two groups of classes are separated by a binary (or multi-class) classifier. In addition to simple reduction stumps, we consider ensembles of such models. Empirically, we show that this kind of reduction, in spite of its simplicity, can often lead to significant performance gains. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.","Automated machine learning; Ensembles; Multi-class classification; Reduction","Classifiers; Data handling; Learning systems; Reduction; Automated machines; Decomposition scheme; Ensembles; Multi-class classification; Multi-class classifier; Multi-class problems; Multiclass classification problems; Nested dichotomies; Classification (of information)","Dheeru, D., Karra Taniskidou, E., (2017) UCI Machine Learning Repository, , http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml; Dong, L., Frank, E., Kramer, S., (2005) Ensembles of Balanced Nested Dichotomies for Multi-Class Problems, 3721, pp. 84-95. , https://doi.org/10.1007/1156412613, Jorge, Alípio Mário, Torgo, Luís, Brazdil, Pavel, Camacho, Rui, Gama, João (eds.)

In MLC, each example can be associated with one or more class labels, making MLC problems harder than conventional (single-label) classification problems. Hence, it is essential to select an MLC algorithm and its configuration tailored (optimized) for the input dataset. Auto-MEKAGGP addresses this problem with two key ideas. First, a large number of choices of MLC algorithms and configurations from MEKA are represented into a grammar. Second, our proposed Grammar-based Genetic Programming (GGP) method uses that grammar to search for the best MLC algorithm and configuration for the input dataset. Auto-MEKAGGP was tested in 10 datasets and compared to two well-known MLC methods, namely Binary Relevance and Classifier Chain, and also compared to GA-Auto-MLC, a genetic algorithm we recently proposed for the same task. Two versions of Auto-MEKAGGP were tested: a full version with the proposed grammar, and a simplified version where the grammar includes only the algorithmic components used by GA-Auto-MLC. Overall, the full version of Auto-MEKAGGP achieved the best predictive accuracy among all five evaluated methods, being the winner in six out of the 10 datasets. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Automated machine learning (Auto-ML); Grammar-based genetic programming; Multi-label classification","Automation; Classification (of information); Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Learning systems; Automated machines; Automated selection; Binary relevances; Class labels; Classifier chains; Grammar-based genetic programming; Multi label classification; Predictive accuracy; Problem solving","de Sá, A.G.C., Freitas, A.A., Pappa, G.L., Multi-label classification search space in the MEKA software.

Additionally, the trend toward precision medicine, in order to tailor decisions and therapies to the individual patient, generates enormous amounts of Comics data. Modern medicine is turning into a data science. The problem is that most of these data are in arbitrarily high dimensions, making manual analysis difficult, yet impossible for humans. This requires automated methods of data science, which is what machine learning provides. Automatic machine learning methods show impressive results in dealing with big data, because such algorithms can learn from training samples to gain knowledge from experience, thus helping to make decisions and predictions. The more data, the better these algorithms perform. Unfortunately, in medicine, we are often confronted with a small number of data sets, “little data,” rare events, and complex data, where automatic approaches suffer from insufficient training sets. This calls for interactive machine learning with a doctor in the loop, who can be beneficial in solving computationally hard problems, where human expertise can help to reduce an exponential search space through heuristic selection of data samples. Therefore, what would otherwise be an NP-hard problem reduces greatly in complexity through the input and the assistance of a medical professional involved in the machine learning pipeline. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Conventional model compression techniques rely on hand-crafted features and require domain experts to explore the large design space trading off among model size, speed, and accuracy, which is usually sub-optimal and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose AutoML for Model Compression (AMC) which leverages reinforcement learning to efficiently sample the design space and can improve the model compression quality. We achieved state-of-the-art model compression results in a fully automated way without any human efforts. Under 4 × FLOPs reduction, we achieved 2.7% better accuracy than the hand-crafted model compression method for VGG-16 on ImageNet. We applied this automated, push-the-button compression pipeline to MobileNet-V1 and achieved a speedup of 1.53 × on the GPU (Titan Xp) and 1.95 × on an Android phone (Google Pixel 1), with negligible loss of accuracy. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.","AutoML;

AutoML relieves human effort by automating the design of ML algorithms. Neural AutoML has become popular for the design of deep learning architectures, however, this method has a high computation cost. To address this we propose Transfer Neural AutoML that uses knowledge from prior tasks to speed up network design. We extend RL-based architecture search methods to support parallel training on multiple tasks and then transfer the search strategy to new tasks.

The aims of this study are: to develop an algorithm for automatic identification of intended jogging periods; and to assess whether the identification performance is improved when using two accelerometers at the hip and ankle, compared to when using only one at either position. Methods: The study used diarized jogging periods and the corresponding accelerometer data from thirty-nine, 15-year-old adolescents, collected under field conditions, as part of the GINIplus study. The data was obtained from two accelerometers placed at the hip and ankle. Automated feature engineering technique was performed to extract features from the raw accelerometer readings and to select a subset of the most significant features. Four machine learning algorithms were used for classification: Logistic regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest and Extremely Randomized Trees. Classification was performed using only data from the hip accelerometer, using only data from ankle accelerometer and using data from both accelerometers. Results: The reported jogging periods were verified by visual inspection and used as golden standard. After the feature selection and tuning of the classification algorithms, all options provided a classification accuracy of at least 0.99, independent of the applied segmentation strategy with sliding windows of either 60s or 180s. The best matching ratio, i.e. the length of correctly identified jogging periods related to the total time including the missed ones, was up to 0.875. It could be additionally improved up to 0.967 by application of post-classification rules, which considered the duration of breaks and jogging periods. There was no obvious benefit of using two accelerometers, rather almost the same performance could be achieved from either accelerometer position. Conclusions: Machine learning techniques can be used for automatic activity recognition, as they provide very accurate activity recognition, significantly more accurate than when keeping a diary. Identification of jogging periods in adolescents can be performed using only one accelerometer. Performance-wise there is no significant benefit from using accelerometers on both locations. © 2017 Zdravevski et al.

To apply machine learning to asset maintenance, turbine asset sensor data is continuously streamed to the cloud where artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms analyze it in real time. The algorithms are trained to detect anomalies in all the asset's signals. Correlations and pattern detections among signals are performed. Instead of looking for breaches of manually set control limits, the algorithms detect abnormal behavior that is indicative of asset degradation and failure. The unsupervised machine learning solution for asset maintenance applies the latest advances in AI to detect abnormal data patterns throughout an entire facility, thereby lowering the cost of reliability maintenance.",,,,"Power",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029161565

Several ADC algorithms have been proposed in the literature. However, the majority of these algorithms assume that the underlying data distribution does not change over time. Previous work has demonstrated evidence of the negative impact of three main temporal effects in representative datasets textual datasets, reflected by variations observed over time in the class distribution, in the pairwise class similarities and in the relationships between terms and classes [1]. In order to minimize the impact of temporal effects in ADC algorithms, we have previously introduced the notion of a temporal weighting function (TWF), which reflects the varying nature of textual datasets. We have also proposed a procedure to derive the TWF's expression and parameters. However, the derivation of the TWF requires the running of explicit and complex statistical tests, which are very cumbersome or can not even be run in several cases. In this article, we propose a machine learning methodology to automatically learn the TWF without the need to perform any statistical tests. We also propose new strategies to incorporate the TWF into ADC algorithms, which we call temporally-aware classifiers. Experiments showed that the fully-automated temporally-aware classifiers achieved significant gains (up to 17%) when compared to their non-temporal counterparts, even outperforming some state-of-the-art algorithms (e.g., SVM) in most cases, with large reductions in execution time. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Automatic document classification; Fully-Automated machine learning process; Temporal weighting function","Artificial intelligence; Information retrieval systems; Learning systems; Statistical tests; Text processing; Class distributions; Class similarities; Document Classification; Fully automated; Machine learning approaches; State-of-the-art algorithms; Temporal weighting functions; Text classification; Classification (of information)","Salles, T., Rocha, L., Gonçalves, M.A., Almeida, J.M., Mourão, F., Meira, W., Viegas, F., A quantitative analysis of the temporal effects on automatic text classification (2016) J.

With this issue in mind, in this work we are interested in a speci.c type of classi.cation problem, called multi-label classi.cation (MLC). In MLC, each example in the dataset can be associated to one or more class labels, making the task considerably harder than traditional, single-label classi.cation. In addition, the cost of learning raises due to the higher complexity of the data. Although the literature has proposed some methods to solve the Auto-ML task, those methods address only the traditional, single-label classi-.cation problem. By contrast, this work proposes the .rst method (an evolutionary algorithm) for solving the Auto-ML task in MLC, i.e., the .rst method for automatically selecting and con.guring the best MLC algorithm for a given input dataset. .e proposed evolutionary algorithm is evaluated on three MLC datasets, and compared against two baseline methods according to four di.erent multi-label predictive accuracy measures. .e results show that the proposed evolutionary algorithm is competitive against the baselines, but there is still room for improvement. © 2017 ACM.","Automatic Machine Learning;

Users of ATM can simply upload a dataset, choose a subset of modeling methods, and choose to use ATM's hybrid Bayesian and multi-armed bandit optimization system. The distributed system works in a load-balanced fashion to quickly deliver results in the form of ready-to-predict models, confusion matrices, cross-validation results, and training timings. By automating hyperparameter tuning and model selection, ATM returns the emphasis of the machine learning workflow to its most irreducible part: feature engineering. We demonstrate the usefulness of ATM on 420 datasets from OpenML and train over 3 million classifiers. Our initial results show ATM can beat human-generated solutions for 30% of the datasets, and can do so in 1/100th of the time. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Big data; Classification (of information); Machine learning; Automated machines; Confusion matrices; Cross validation; Distributed systems; Feature engineerings; Multi armed bandit; Optimization system; Scalable systems; Automatic teller machines","Thornton, C., Hutter, F., Hoos, H.H., Leyton-Brown, K., Auto-WEKA (2013) Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining-KDD '13, p. 847; Feurer, M., Klein, A., Eggensperger, K., Springenberg, J., Blum, M., Hutter, F., Efficient and robust automated machine learning (2015) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 28, pp. 2944-2952; Olson, R.S., Moore, J.H., TPOT: A tree-based pipeline optimization tool for automating machine learning (2016) Proceedings of the Workshop on Automatic Machine Learning, 64, pp. 66-74; Hall, M., Frank, E., Holmes, G., Pfahringer, B., Reutemann, P., Witten, I.H., The WEKA data mining software (2009) ACM SIGKDD Explorations, 11 (1), pp. 10-18; Martin Salvador, M., Budka, M., Gabrys, B., Adapting multicomponent predictive systems using hybrid adaptation strategies with auto-WEKA in process industry (2016) AutoML at ICML, (2011), pp. 1-8; Brazdil, P., Giraud-Carrier, C., Soares, C., Vilalta, R., (2008) Metalearning: Applications to Data Mining, , Springer Science & Business Media; Abdulrahman, S.M., Brazdil, P., Effect of incomplete meta-dataset on average ranking method (2016) Proceedings of the Workshop on Automatic Machine Learning, 64, pp. 1-10; Dewancker, I., McCourt, M., Clark, S., Hayes, P., Johnson, A., Ke, G., A strategy for ranking optimization methods using multiple criteria (2016) Workshop on Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), ICML, pp. 1-12; Kim, J., AutoML challenge : AutoML framework using random space partitioning optimizer (2016) Workshop on Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), ICML, pp. 1-4; Kim, H., Teh, Y.W., Scalable structure discovery in regression using Gaussian processes (2016) Workshop on Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), ICML, pp. 1-11; Li, L., Jamieson, K., DeSalvo, G., Rostamizadeh, A., Talwalkar, A., (2016) Efficient Hyperparameter Optimization and Infinitely Many Armed Bandits; Snoek, J., Larochelle, H., Adams, R.P., Practical Bayesian optimization of machine learning algorithms (2012) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 2951-2959; Vanschoren, J., Van Rijn, J.N., Bischl, B., Torgo, L., Openml: Networked science in machine learning (2013) SIGKDD Explorations, 15 (2), pp. 49-60","Proc. - IEEE Int.

However, effectively using machine learning methods requires considerable domain expertise, which can be a barrier of entry for bioinformaticians new to computational data science methods. Therefore, off-the-shelf tools that make machine learning more accessible can prove invaluable for bioinfor-maticians. To this end, we have developed an open source pipeline optimization tool (TPOT-MDR) that uses genetic programming to automatically design machine learning pipelines for bioinformatics studies. In TPOT-MDR, we implement Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) as a feature construction method for modeling higher-order feature interactions, and combine it with a new expert knowledge-guided feature selector for large biomedical data sets. We demonstrate TPOT-MDR's capabilities using a combination of simulated and real world data sets from human genetics and find that TPOT-MDR significantly outperforms modern machine learning methods such as logistic regression and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). We further analyze the best pipeline discovered by TPOT-MDR for a real world problem and highlight TPOT-MDR's ability to produce a high-accuracy solution that is also easily interpretable. © 2017 ACM.","Automated machine learning; Bioinformatics; Genetic programming; Genetics; Multifactor dimensionality reduction; Python","Adaptive boosting; Artificial intelligence; Bioinformatics; Chromosomes; Education; Genetic algorithms; Learning systems; Open source software; Pipelines; Automated machines; Genetics; Genome-wide association studies; Logistic regressions; Machine learning methods; Multifactor dimensionality reductions; Pipeline optimization; Python; Genetic programming","Banzhaf, W., Nordin, P., Keller, R.E., Francone, F.D., (1998) Genetic Programming: An Introduction, , Morgan Kaufmann Publishers San Francisco; Bergstra, J., Bengio, Y., Random search for hyper-parameter optimization (2012) JMLR, 13, pp. 281-305. , Feb (2012); Bird, A., Perceptions of epigenetics (2007) Nature, 447 (7143), pp. 396-398. , (2007); Chen, T., Guestrin, C., Xgboost: A scalable tree boosting system (2016) Proceedings of the 22Nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 785-794. , ACM; Cordell, H.J., Detecting gene-gene interactions that underlie human diseases (2009) Nature ReviewsGenetics, 10 (6), pp. 392-404. , (2009); De Sa, A.G.C., Pinto, W.J.G.S., Oliveira, L.O.V.B., Pappa, G.L., Recipe: A grammar-based framework for automatically evolving classification pipelines (2017) European Conference on Genetic Programming, pp. 246-261. , Springer; Deb, K., Pratap, A., Agarwal, S., Meyarivan, T., A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: Nsga-II (2002) IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6, pp. 182-197. , (2002); Feurer, M., Klein, A., Eggensperger, K., Springenberg, J., Blum, M., Hutter, F., Efficient and robust automated machine learning (2015) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 2962-2970; Forrest, S., Nguyen, T., Weimer, W., Le Goues, C., A genetic programming approach to automated software repair (2009) GECCO '09, pp. 947-954. , ACM; Fortin, F., De Rainville, F., Gardner, M., Parizeau, M., Gagne, C., Deap: Evolutionary algorithms made easy (2012) JMLR, 13, pp. 2171-2175. , (2012); Franken, H., Seitz, A., Lehmann, R., Haring, H., Stefan, N., Zell, A., Inferring disease-related metabolite dependencies with a Bayesian optimization algorithm (2012) European Conference on Evolutionary Computation, Machine Learning and Data Mining in Bioinformatics, pp. 62-73. , Springer; Fredericks, E.M., Cheng, B.H.C., Exploring automated software composition with genetic programming (2013) GECCO '13, pp. 1733-1734. , ACM; Granizo-Mackenzie, D., Moore, J.H., Multiple threshold spatially uniform relieff for the genetic analysis of complex human diseases (2013) European Conference on Evolutionary Computation, Machine Learning and Data Mining in Bioinformatics, pp. 1-10. , Springer; Greene, C.S., Himmelstein, D.S., Kiralis, J., Moore, J.H., The informative extremes: Using both nearest and farthest individuals can improve relief algorithms in the domain of human genetics (2010) European Conference on Evolutionary Computation, Machine Learning and Data Mining in Bioinformatics, pp. 182-193. , Springer; Greene, C.S., Penrod, N.M., Kiralis, J., Moore, J.H., Spatially uniform relieff (surf) for computationally-efficient filtering of gene-gene interactions (2009) BioData Mining, 2 (1), p. 5. , (2009); Hahn, L.W., Ritchie, M.D., Moore, J.H., Multifactor dimensionality reduction software for detecting gene-gene and gene-environment interactions (2003) Bioinformatics, 19 (3), pp. 376-382. , (2003); Hastie, T.J., Tibshirani, R.J., Friedman, J.H., (2009) The Elements OfStatistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, , Springer, New York, NY, USA; Hornby, G.S., Lohn, J.D., Linden, D.S., Computerautomated evolution of an x-band antenna for nasa's space technology 5 mission (2011) Evolutionary Computation, 19, pp. 1-23. , (2011); Hutter, F., Lucke, J., Schmidt-Thieme, L., Beyond manual tuning of hyperparameters (2015) KI-Kiunstliche Intelligenz, 29 (4), pp. 329-337. , (2015); Kalousis, A., (2002) Algorithm Selection Via Meta-learning, , Ph.D. Dissertation.

One of the techniques behind most of these successful applications is Ensemble Learning (EL), the field of ML that gave birth to methods such as Random Forests or Boosting. The complexity of applying these techniques together with the market scarcity on ML experts, has created the need for systems that enable a fast and easy drop-in replacement for ML libraries. Automated machine learning (autoML) is the field of ML that attempts to answers these needs. We propose autoBagging, an autoML system that automatically ranks 63 bagging workflows by exploiting past performance and metalearning. Results on 140 classification datasets from the OpenML platform show that autoBagging can yield better performance than the Average Rank method and achieve results that are not statistically different from an ideal model that systematically selects the best workflow for each dataset. For the purpose of reproducibility and generalizability, autoBagging is publicly available as an R package on CRAN.","Automated machine learning; Bagging; Classification; Metalearning","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Learning systems; Automated machines; Bagging; Classification datasets; Ensemble learning; Learning to rank; Metalearning; Random forests; Reproducibilities; Learning algorithms","Brazdil, P., Carrier, C.G., Soares, C., Vilalta, R., (2008) Metalearning: Applications to Data Mining, , Springer Science & Business Media; Breiman, L., Bagging predictors (1996) Machine Learning, 24 (2), pp. 123-140; Chen, T., Guestrin, C., (2016) Xgboost: A Scalable Tree Boosting System, pp. 785-794. , KDD '16, ACM; Cohen, J., A coeffcient of agreement for nominal scales (1960) Educational and Psychological Measurement, 20 (1), pp. 37-46; Demsar, J., Statistical comparisons of classiffers over multiple data sets (2006) JMLR, 7, pp. 1-30. , Jan; Ko, A.H., Sabourin, R., Britto, Jr.A.S., From dynamic classiffer selection to dynamic ensemble selection (2008) Pattern Recognition, 41 (5), pp. 1718-1731; Liu, T.Y., Learning to rank for information retrieval (2009) Foundations and Trends® in Information Retrieval, 3 (3), pp. 225-331; Martinez-Munoz, G., Hernandez-Lobato, D., Suarez, A., An, analysis of ensemble pruning techniques based on ordered aggregation (2009) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 31 (2), pp. 245-259; Pfahringer, B., Bensusan, H., Giraud-Carrier, C., Tell me who can learn you and i can tell you who you are: Landmarking various learning algorithms (2000) ICML, pp. 743-750; Pinto, F., Soares, C., Mendes-Moreira, J., Towards automatic generation of metafeatures (2016) PAKDD, pp. 215-226. , Springer; Reshef, D.N., Reshef, Y.A., Finucane, H.K., Grossman, S.R., McVean, G., Turnbaugh, P.J., Lander, E.S., Sabeti, P.C., Detecting novel associations in large data sets (2011) Science, 334 (6062), pp. 1518-1524; Vanschoren, J., Van Rijn, J.N., Bischl, B., Torgo, L., Openml: Networked science in machine learning (2014) ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter, 15 (2), pp. 49-60; Woods, K., Kegelmeyer, Jr.W.P., Bowyer, K., Combination of multiple classiffers using local accuracy estimates (1997) Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 19 (4), pp. 405-410","CEUR Workshop Proc.",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85037057823

The background knowledge required to solve the task at hand is actually embedded into a search mechanism that builds personalized solutions to the task. Following this idea, this paper proposes RECIPE (REsilient ClassifIcation Pipeline Evolution), a framework based on grammar-based genetic programming that builds customized classification pipelines. The framework is flexible enough to receive different grammars and can be easily extended to other machine learning tasks. RECIPE overcomes the drawbacks of previous evolutionary-based frameworks, such as generating invalid individuals, and organizes a high number of possible suitable data pre-processing and classification methods into a grammar. Results of f-measure obtained by RECIPE are compared to those two state-of-the-art methods, and shown to be as good as or better than those previously reported in the literature. RECIPE represents a first step towards a complete framework for dealing with different machine learning tasks with the minimum required human intervention. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Automatic machine learning; Classification; Grammar-based genetic programming","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Data handling; Genetic algorithms; Learning systems; Network function virtualization; Pipelines; Automatic machines; Back-ground knowledge; Classification methods; Data preprocessing; Grammar-based genetic programming; Human intervention; Hyper-heuristics; Search mechanism; Genetic programming","Banzhaf, W., Francone, F.D., Keller, R.E., Nordin, P., (1998) Genetic Programming -An Introduction: On the Automatic Evolution of Computer Programs and Its Applications, , Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc., Burlington; Pappa, G.L., Ochoa, G., Hyde, M.R., Freitas, A.A., Woodward, J., Swan, J., Contrasting meta-learning and hyper-heuristic research: The role of evolutionary algorithms (2014) Genet.

In this study the automated design of genetic programming classification algorithms is proposed. A number of design decisions have to be considered by algorithm designers during the design process and this is usually a time consuming task. Our automated design approach uses a genetic algorithm to automatically configure a genetic programming classification algorithm. The genetic algorithm determines parameter values and sets the flow control for the classification algorithm. The proposed system is tested on real world problems and the results indicate that induced classifiers perform better than manually designed classifiers. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Automated machine learning; Data classification; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Design; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Learning systems; Automated machines; Classification algorithm; Data classification; Design decisions; Machine learning communities; Machine learning techniques; Real-world problem; Time-consuming tasks; Evolutionary algorithms","Back, T., (1996) Evolutionary Algorithms in Theory and Practice: Evolution Strategies, , Evolutionary Programming, Genetic Algorithms.

Methodology/results: The process of descriptor generation, feature selection and the creation of a large number of QSAR models has been automated into a single workflow within AutoQSAR. The models are built using a variety of machine-learning methods, and each model is scored using a novel approach. Effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through comparison with literature QSAR models using identical datasets for six end points: protein-ligand binding affinity, solubility, blood-brain barrier permeability, carcinogenicity, mutagenicity and bioaccumulation in fish. Conclusion: AutoQSAR demonstrates similar or better predictive performance as compared with published results for four of the six endpoints while requiring minimal human time and expertise. © 2016 Future Science Ltd.","binding affinity prediction; blood-brain barrier permeability; carcinogenicity; fish bioconcentration factor; mutagenicity; QSAR; solubility","ligand; Article; automation; bioaccumulation; blood brain barrier; carcinogenicity; consensus; human; ligand binding; machine learning; mutagenicity; priority journal; protein binding; quantitative structure activity relation; solubility","Li, J., Ballmer, S.G., Gillis, E.P., Synthesis of many different types of organic small molecules using one automated process (2015) Science, 347 (6227), pp. 1221-1226; Szymkuć, S., Gajewska, E.P., Klucznik, T., Computerassisted synthetic planning: The end of the beginning (2016) Angew.

This scenario leads to an extra coding-effort to achieve both the desired interoperability and a better provenance level as well as a more automatized environment for obtaining the generated results. Hence, when using ML libraries, it is a common task to re-design specific data models (schemata) and develop wrappers to manage the produced outputs. In this article, we discuss this gap focusing on the solution for the question: ""What is the cleanest and lowest-impact solution, i.e., the minimal effort to achieve both higher interoperability and provenance metadata levels in the Integrated Development Environments (IDE) context and how to facilitate the inherent data querying task?"". We introduce a novel and low-impact methodology specifically designed for code built in that context, combining Semantic Web concepts and reflection in order to minimize the gap for exporting ML metadata in a structured manner, allowing embedded code annotations that are, in run-time, converted in one of the state-of-the-art ML schemas for the Semantic Web: MEX Vocabulary. © 2016 ACM.","Annotation; Interoperability; Machine learning outputs; Metadata; MEX; Provenance; Reflection; Reproducible research","Artificial intelligence; Codes (symbols); Interoperability; Metadata; Reflection; Semantic Web; Annotation; Data and metadata; Integrated development environment; Metadata generation; Provenance; Provenance levels; Reproducible research; State of the art; Learning systems","Esteves, D., Moussallem, D., Neto, C.B., Soru, T., Usbeck, R., Ackermann, M., Lehmann, J., MEX Vocabulary: A Lightweight Interchange Format for Machine Learning Experiments (2015) Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Semantic Systems, pp. 169-176. , ACM; Callahan, S.P., Freire, J., Santos, E., Scheidegger, C.E., Silva, C.T., Vo, H.T., Vistrails: Visualization meets data management (2006) Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, SIGMOD '06, pp. 745-747. , New York, NY, USA, ACM; Tcheremenskaia, O., Benigni, R., Nikolova, I., Jeliazkova, N., Escher, S., Batke, M., Baier, T., Rautenberg, M., Opentox predictive toxicology framework: Toxicological ontology and semantic media wiki-based opentoxipedia (2012) J.

Our approach starts by defining a large space of related probabilistic models via a grammar over models, and then uses Bayesian marginal likelihood computations to search over this space for one or a few good models of the data. The aim is to find models which have both good predictive performance, and are somewhat interpretable. The Automatic Statistician generates a natural language summary of the analysis, producing a 10‒15 page report with plots and tables describing the analysis. I will also link this to recent work we have been doing in the area of Probabilistic Programming (including an new system in Julia) to automate inference, and on the rational allocation of computational resources (and our entry in the AutoML conference). © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",,"Artificial intelligence; Computational resources; Exploratory analysis; Large spaces; Marginal likelihood; Natural languages; Predictive performance; Probabilistic models; Probabilistic programming; Learning systems",,"Lect.

Machine learning is a major predictive modeling approach, but two barriers make its use in healthcare challenging. First, a machine learning tool user must choose an algorithm and assign one or more model parameters called hyper-parameters before model training. The algorithm and hyper-parameter values used typically impact model accuracy by over 40 %, but their selection requires many laborintensive manual iterations that can be difficult even for computer scientists. Second, many clinical attributes are repeatedly recorded over time, requiring temporal aggregation before predictive modeling can be performed. Many labor-intensive manual iterations are required to identify a good pair of aggregation period and operator for each clinical attribute. Both barriers result in time and human resource bottlenecks, and preclude healthcare administrators and researchers from asking a series of what-if questions when probing opportunities to use predictive models to improve outcomes and reduce costs. Methods: This paper describes our design of and vision for PredicT-ML (prediction tool using machine learning), a software system that aims to overcome these barriers and automate machine learning model building with big clinical data. Results: The paper presents the detailed design of PredicT-ML. Conclusions: PredicT-ML will open the use of big clinical data to thousands of healthcare administrators and researchers and increase the ability to advance clinical research and improve healthcare. © 2016 The Author(s).","Automated temporal aggregation; Automatic algorithm selection; Automatic hyper-parameter value selection; Big clinical data; Machine learning","accuracy; algorithm; Article; clinical research; health care management; machine learning; prediction; priority journal; software","Luo, G., Stone, B.L., Sakaguchi, F., Sheng, X., Murtaugh, M.A., Using computational approaches to improve risk-stratified patient management: rationale and methods (2015) JMIR Res Protoc, 4 (4); Steyerberg, E.W., (2009) Clinical prediction models: a practical approach to development, validation, and updating, , New York: Springer; (2015) Jvion's latest predictive analytics in healthcare survey finds that advanced predictive modeling solutions are taking a strong foothold in the industry, , http://www.chimecentral.org/jvion-releases-findings-latestpredictive-analytics-healthcare-survey/, Accessed 1 Apr 2016; Luo, G., Automatically explaining machine learning prediction results: a demonstration on type 2 diabetes risk prediction (2016) Health Inf Sci Syst, 4, p. 2; Witten, I.H., Frank, E., Hall, M.A., (2011) Data mining: practical machine learning tools and techniques, , 3rd ed.

We, with a practical point of view, utilized shallow learning algorithms to construct a learning pipeline such that operators can utilize machine learning without any special knowledge, expensive computation environment, and a large amount of labelled data. The proposed pipeline automates a whole classification process, namely feature-selection, weighting features and the selection of the most suitable classifier with optimized hyperparameters. The configuration facilitates particle swarm optimization, one of well-known metaheuristic algorithms for the sake of generally fast and fine optimization, which enables us not only to optimize (hyper)parameters but also to determine appropriate features/classifier to the problem, which has conventionally been a priori based on domain knowledge and remained untouched or dealt with naïve algorithms such as grid search. Through experiments with the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, common datasets in computer vision field for character recognition and object recognition problems respectively, our automated learning approach provides high performance considering its simple setting (i.e. non-specialized setting depending on dataset), small amount of training data, and practical learning time. Moreover, compared to deep learning the performance stays robust without almost any modification even with a remote sensing object recognition problem, which in turn indicates that there is a high possibility that our approach contributes to general classification problems.","Automated Machine Learning; Classification; Feature Generation; Meta-heuristic Hyperparameter Optimization; Particle Swarm Optimization; UC Merced Land Use data set","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Automation; Character recognition; Classification (of information); Computer vision; Land use; Learning systems; Object recognition; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Personnel training; Pipelines; Remote sensing; Automated machines; Computation environments; Data set; Feature generation; Hyper-parameter optimizations; Machine learning methods; Meta heuristic algorithm; Object recognition problem; Learning algorithms","Abadi, M., Zheng, X., (2015) TensorFlow: Largescale Machine Learning on Heterogeneous Systems, , Software available from tensorflow.org; Basu, S., Ganguly, D., Mukhopadhyay, S., DiBiano, R., Karki, M., Nemani, R., Deepsat-A learning framework for satellite imagery (2015) CoRR abs/1509, p. 03602; Bradski, G., (2000) Dobbs Journal of Software Tools, , Opencv.

We discuss two strategies towards this goal: (1) automated optimization of hyperparameters (including mechanisms for feature selection, preprocessing, model selection, etc) and (2) the development of algorithms with reduced sets of hyperparameters. Since many research directions (e.g., deep learning), show a tendency towards increasingly complex algorithms with more and more hyperparamters, the demand for both of these strategies continuously increases. We review recent hyperparameter optimization methods and discuss data-driven approaches to avoid the introduction of hyperparameters using unsupervised learning. We end in discussing how these complementary strategies can work hand-in-hand, representing a very promising approach towards autonomous machine learning. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Automatic machine learning; Autonomous learning; Deep learning; Hyperparameter optimization",,"Adams, R.P., Wallach, H.M., Ghahramani, Z., (2009) Learning the Structure of Deep Sparse Graphical Models, , ArXiv preprint, arXiv; Aha, D.W., Generalizing from case studies: A case study (1992) ML, pp. 1-10; Bardenet, R., Brendel, M., Kégl, B., Sebag, M., Collaborative hyperparameter tuning (2013) Proceeidngs of ICML’13; Bengio, Y., Gradient-based optimization of hyperparameters (2000) Neural Comput, 12 (8), pp. 1889-1900; Bergstra, J., Bardenet, R., Bengio, Y., Kégl, B., Algorithms for hyper-parameter optimization (2011) Proceedings of NIPS’11; Bergstra, J., Bengio, Y., Random search for hyper-parameter optimization (2012) JMLR, 13, pp. 281-305; Bergstra, J., Cox, D., (2013) Hyperparameter Optimization and Boosting for Classifying Facial Expressions: How Good Can a “null” Model Be?; Bergstra, J., Yamins, D., Cox, D.D., Making a science of model search: Hyperparameter optimization in hundreds of dimensions for vision architectures (2013) Proceedings of ICML’13; Berkes, P., Turner, R., Sahani, M., On sparsity and overcompleteness in image models (2008) Proceedings of NIPS’08, 21; Blockeel, H., Experiment databases: A novel methodology for experimental research (2006) Knowledge Discovery in Inductive Databases, pp. 72-85. , Springer; Brazdil, P., Gama, J., Henery, B., Characterizing the applicability of classification algorithms using meta-level learning (1994) Proceedings of ECML’94, pp. 83-102; Brochu, E., Cora, V., Freitas, N., (2010) A tutorial on Bayesian optimization of expensive cost functions, with application to active user modeling and hierarchical reinforcement learning; Castiello, C., Castellano, G., Fanelli, A.M., Meta-data: Characterization of input features for meta-learning (2005) Modeling Decisions for Artificial Intelligence, pp. 457-468. , Springer; Ciresan, D., Meier, U., Schmidhuber, J., Multi-column deep neural networks for image classification (2012) Proceedings of CVPR’12, pp. 3642-3649. , IEEE; Dayan, P., Recognition in hierarchical models (1997) Foundations of Computational Mathematics, pp. 43-62. , Springer; Domhan, T., Springenberg, T., Hutter, F., Extrapolating learning curves of deep neural networks (2014) ICML 2014 Automl Workshop; Eggensperger, K., Feurer, M., Hutter, F., Bergstra, J., Snoek, J., Hoos, H., Leyton-Brown, K., Towards an empirical foundation for assessing Bayesian optimization of hyperparameters (2013) NIPS Workshop on Bayesian Optimization in Theory and Practice; Engels, R., Theusinger, C., Using a data metric for preprocessing advice for data mining applications (1998) Proceedings of ECAI’98, pp. 430-434; Fawcett, C., Hoos, H., Analysing differences between algorithm configurations through ablation (2013) Proceedings of MIC’13, pp. 123-132; Feurer, M., Springenberg, T., Hutter, F., Initializing Bayesian hyperparameter optimization via meta-learning (2015) Proceedings of AAAI’15; Gomes, T.A.F., Prudêncio, R.B.C., Soares, C., Rossi, A.L.D., Carvalho, A.C.P.L.F.: combining meta-learning and search techniques to select parameters for support vector machines (2012) Neurocomputing, 75 (1), pp. 3-13; Goodfellow, I., Courville, A.C., Bengio, Y., Large-scale feature learning with spike-and-slab sparse coding (2012) Proceedings of ICML’12; Griffiths, T.L., Kemp, C., Tenenbaum, J.B., Bayesian models of cognition (2008) Cambridge Handbook of Computational Psychology, , Sun R, Cambridge University Press, New York, NY, USA; Gross, S., Mokbel, B., Hammer, B., Pinkwart, N., Feedback provision strategies in intelligent tutoring systems based on clustered solution spaces (2012) Delfi 2012: Die 10.

However, there is no obligation to submit code; half of the prizes can be won by submitting prediction results only. Datasets of progressively increasing difficulty are introduced throughout the six rounds of the challenge. (Participants can enter the competition in any round.) The rounds alternate phases in which learners are tested on datasets participants have not seen, and phases in which participants have limited time to tweak their algorithms on those datasets to improve performance. This challenge will push the state of the art in fully automatic machine learning on a wide range of real-world problems.

To be effective in practice, such systems need to automatically choose a good algorithm and feature preprocessing steps for a new dataset at hand, and also set their respective hyperparameters. Recent work has started to tackle this automated machine learning (AutoML) problem with the help of efficient Bayesian optimization methods. Building on this, we introduce a robust new AutoML system based on scikit-learn (using 15 classifiers, 14 feature preprocessing methods, and 4 data preprocessing methods, giving rise to a structured hypothesis space with 110 hyperparameters). This system, which we dub AUTO-SKLEARN, improves on existing AutoML methods by automatically taking into account past performance on similar datasets, and by constructing ensembles from the models evaluated during the optimization. Our system won the first phase of the ongoing ChaLearn AutoML challenge, and our comprehensive analysis on over 100 diverse datasets shows that it substantially outperforms the previous state of the art in AutoML. We also demonstrate the performance gains due to each of our contributions and derive insights into the effectiveness of the individual components of AUTO-SKLEARN.",,"Artificial intelligence; Information science; Automated machines; Bayesian optimization; Comprehensive analysis; Data preprocessing; Individual components; Pre-processing method; Pre-processing step; Structured hypothesis; Learning systems","Guyon, I., Bennett, K., Cawley, G., Escalante, H., Escalera, S., Ho, T., Macià, N., Viegas, E., Design of the 2015 ChaLearn AutoML challenge (2015) Proc. of IJCNN'15; Thornton, C., Hutter, F., Hoos, H., Leyton-Brown, K., Auto-WEKA: Combined selection and hyperparameter optimization of classification algorithms (2013) Proc. of KDD'13, pp. 847-855; Brochu, E., Cora, V., De Freitas, N., (2010) A Tutorial on Bayesian Optimization of Expensive Cost Functions, with Application to Active User Modeling and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning, , CoRR, abs/1012.2599; Feurer, M., Springenberg, J., Hutter, F., Initializing Bayesian hyperparameter optimization via metalearning (2015) Proc. of AAAI'15, pp. 1128-1135; Reif, M., Shafait, F., Dengel, A., Meta-learning for evolutionary parameter optimization of classifiers (2012) Machine Learning, 87, pp. 357-380; Gomes, T., Prudêncio, R., Soares, C., Rossi, A., Carvalho, A., Combining meta-learning and search techniques to select parameters for support vector machines (2012) Neurocomputing, 75 (1), pp. 3-13; Pedregosa, F., Varoquaux, G., Gramfort, A., Michel, V., Thirion, B., Grisel, O., Blondel, M., Duchesnay, E., Scikit-learn: Machine learning in Python (2011) JMLR, 12, pp. 2825-2830; Hall, M., Frank, E., Holmes, G., Pfahringer, B., Reutemann, P., Witten, I., The WEKA data mining software: An update (2009) SIGKDD, 11 (1), pp. 10-18; Hutter, F., Hoos, H., Leyton-Brown, K., Sequential model-based optimization for general algorithm configuration (2011) Proc. of LION'11, pp. 507-523; Bergstra, J., Bardenet, R., Bengio, Y., Kégl, B., Algorithms for hyper-parameter optimization (2011) Proc. of NIPS'11, pp. 2546-2554; Snoek, J., Larochelle, H., Adams, R.P., Practical Bayesian optimization of machine learning algorithms (2012) Proc. of NIPS'12, pp. 2960-2968; Eggensperger, K., Feurer, M., Hutter, F., Bergstra, J., Snoek, J., Hoos, H., Leyton-Brown, K., Towards an empirical foundation for assessing Bayesian optimization of hyperparameters (2013) NIPS Workshop on Bayesian Optimization in Theory and Practice; Komer, B., Bergstra, J., Eliasmith, C., Hyperopt-sklearn: Automatic hyperparameter configuration for scikit-learn (2014) ICML Workshop on AutoML; Breiman, L., Random forests (2001) MLJ, 45, pp. 5-32; Brazdil, P., Giraud-Carrier, C., Soares, C., Vilalta, R., (2009) Metalearning: Applications to Data Mining, , Springer; Bardenet, R., Brendel, M., Kégl, B., Sebag, M., Collaborative hyperparameter tuning Proc. of ICML'13 [28], pp. 199-207; Yogatama, D., Mann, G., Efficient transfer learning method for automatic hyperparameter tuning (2014) Proc. of AISTATS'14, pp. 1077-1085; Vanschoren, J., Van Rijn, J., Bischl, B., Torgo, L., OpenML: Networked science in machine learning (2013) SIGKDD Explorations, 15 (2), pp. 49-60; Michie, D., Spiegelhalter, D., Taylor, C., Campbell, J., (1994) Machine Learning, Neural and Statistical Classification, , Ellis Horwood; Kalousis, A., (2002) Algorithm Selection Via Meta-learning, , PhD thesis, University of Geneve; Pfahringer, B., Bensusan, H., Giraud-Carrier, C., Meta-learning by landmarking various learning algorithms (2000) Proc. of (ICML'00), pp. 743-750; Guyon, I., Saffari, A., Dror, G., Cawley, G., Model selection: Beyond the Bayesian/Frequentist divide (2010) JMLR, 11, pp. 61-87; Lacoste, A., Marchand, M., Laviolette, F., Larochelle, H., Agnostic Bayesian learning of ensembles (2014) Proc. of ICML'14, pp. 611-619; Caruana, R., Niculescu-Mizil, A., Crew, G., Ksikes, A., Ensemble selection from libraries of models (2004) Proc. of ICML'04, p. 18; Caruana, R., Munson, A., Niculescu-Mizil, A., Getting the most out of ensemble selection (2006) Proc. of ICDM'06, pp. 828-833; Wolpert, D., Stacked generalization (1992) Neural Networks, 5, pp. 241-259; Hamerly, G., Elkan, C., Learning the k in k-means (2004) Proc. of NIPS'04, pp. 281-288; (2014) Proc. of ICML'13","Adv. neural inf. proces. syst.",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84965128050

This study investigated whether subjects undergoing such screening who are at risk of a CVE can be identified using automatic image analysis and subject characteristics. Moreover, the study examined whether these individuals can be identified using solely image information, or if a combination of image and subject data is needed. A set of 3559 male subjects undergoing Dutch-Belgian lung cancer screening trial was included. Low-dose non-ECG synchronized chest CT images acquired at baseline were analyzed (1834 scanned in the University Medical Center Groningen, 1725 in the University Medical Center Utrecht). Aortic and coronary calcifications were identified using previously developed automatic algorithms. A set of features describing number, volume and size distribution of the detected calcifications was computed. Age of the participants was extracted from image headers. Features describing participants' smoking status, smoking history and past CVEs were obtained. CVEs that occurred within three years after the imaging were used as outcome. Support vector machine classification was performed employing different feature sets using sets of only image features, or a combination of image and subject related characteristics. Classification based solely on the image features resulted in the area under the ROC curve (Az) of 0.69. A combination of image and subject features resulted in an Az of 0.71. The results demonstrate that subjects undergoing lung cancer screening who are at risk of CVE can be identified using automatic image analysis. Adding subject information slightly improved the performance. © 2015 SPIE.",,"Artificial intelligence; Biological organs; Biomineralization; Bone; Classification (of information); Computer aided diagnosis; Diagnosis; Diseases; Hospitals; Image acquisition; Image analysis; Image processing; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Risk assessment; Area under the ROC curve; Automatic algorithms; Automatic image analysis; Automatic machines; Cardiovascular event; Coronary calcifications; Lung cancer screening; Support vector machine classification; Computerized tomography","Mets, O.M., Vliegenthart, R., Gondrie, M.J., Viergever, M.A., Oudkerk, M., De Koning, H.J., Willem, P.T.M., Van Der Graaf, Y., Lung cancer screening CT-based prediction of cardiovascular events (2013) JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging, 6 (8), pp. 899-907; Aberle, D.R., Adams, A.M., Berg, C.D., Black, W.C., Clapp, J.D., Fagerstrom, R.M., Gareen, I.F., Sicks, J., Reduced lung-cancer mortality with low-dose computed tomographic screening (2011) The New England Journal of Medicine, 365 (5), pp. 395-409; Jacobs, P.C., Gondrie, M.J., Van Der Graaf, Y., De Koning, H.J., Isgum, I., Van Ginneken, B., Mali, W.P., Coronary artery calcium can predict all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events on low-dose CT screening for lung cancer (2012) American Journal of Roentgenology, 198 (3), pp. 505-511; Budo, M.J., Shaw, L.J., Liu, S.T., Weinstein, S.R., Mosler, T.P., Tseng, P.H., Flores, F.R., Berman, D.S., Long-term prognosis associated with coronary calciffcation observa-tions from a registry of 25,253 patients (2007) Journal of the American College of Cardiology, 49 (18), pp. 1860-1870; Shaw, L.J., Raggi, P., Callister, T.Q., Berman, D.S., Prognostic value of coronary artery calcium screening in asymptomatic smokers and non-smokers (2006) European Heart Journal, 27 (8), pp. 968-975; Budo, M.J., Gul, K.M., Expert review on coronary calcium (2008) Vascular Health and Risk Manage-ment, 4 (2), p. 315; Xu, D.M., Gietema, H., De Koning, H., Vernhout, R., Nackaerts, K., Prokop, M., Weenink, C., Oudkerk, M., Nodule management protocol of the NELSON randomised lung cancer screening trial (2006) Lung Cancer, 54 (2), pp. 177-184; Isgum, I., Rutten, A., Prokop, M., Staring, M., Klein, S., Pluim, J.P.W., Viergever, M.A., Van Ginneken, B., Automated aortic calcium scoring on low-dose chest computed tomography (2010) Medi-cal Physics, 37 (2), pp. 714-723; Isgum, I., Prokop, M., Niemeijer, M., Viergever, M., Van Ginneken, B., Automatic coronary calcium scoring in low-dose chest computed tomography (2012) Medical Imaging IEEE Transactions on, 31 (12), pp. 2322-2334; Cortes, C., Vapnik, V., Support-vector networks (1995) Machine Learning, 20 (3), pp. 273-297; Chang, C.-C., Lin, C.-J., Libsvm: A library for support vector machines (2011) ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST), 2 (3), p. 27; Sabuncu, M.R., A Bayesian algorithm for image-based time-to-event prediction (2013) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 8184, pp. 74-81. , [Machine Learning in Medical Imaging]Wu, G., Zhang, D., Shen, D., Yan, P., Suzuki, K., Wang, F., eds, Springer International Publishing","Progr.

One has to look for a certain number of nearest neighbors, according to some distance. The first idea that comes to mind when we see the nearest neighbor time series forecasting technique is to weigh the contribution of the different neighbors according to distance to the present observation. The fuzzy version of the nearest neighbor time series forecasting technique implicitly weighs the contribution of the different neighbors to the prediction, using the fuzzy membership of the linguistic terms as a kind of distance to the current observation. The training phase compiles all different scenarios of what has been observed in the time series’ past as a set of fuzzy rules. When we encounter a new situation and need to predict the future outcome, just like in normal fuzzy inference systems, the current observation is fuzzyfied, the set of rules is traversed to see which ones of them are activated (i.e., their antecedents are satisfied) and the outcome of the forecast is defuzzyfied by the common center of gravity rule. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Automatic machine learning; Fuzzy reasoning; Time series forecasting","Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Forecasting; Learning systems; Linguistics; Nearest neighbor search; Social sciences; Time series; Automatic machines; Center of gravity; Fuzzy inference systems; Fuzzy membership; Fuzzy reasoning; Linguistic terms; Nearest neighbors; Time series forecasting; Fuzzy inference","Baldi, P., Brunak, S., (2001) Bioinformatics: The Machine Learning Approach, , MIT press; Brookwell, P.J., Davis, R.A., (2002) Introduction to Time Series and Forecasting, , Springer; Casdagli, M., Nonlinear prediction of chaotic time series (1989) Physica D, 35 (3), pp. 335-356; Cowpertwait, P.S., Metcalfe, A.V., (2009) Introductory Time Series with R, , Springer; Farmer, J.D., Sidorowich, J.J., Predicting chaotic time series (1987) Phys.

We present a system using a forest of extremely randomized trees to automatically identify and quantify CAC in routinely acquired cardiac non-contrast enhanced CT. Candidate lesions the system could not label with high certainty were automatically identified and presented to an expert who could relabel them to achieve high scoring accuracy with minimal effort. The study included 200 consecutive non-contrast enhanced ECG-triggered cardiac CTs (120 kV, 55 mAs, 3 mm section thickness). Expert CAC annotations made as part of the clinical routine served as the reference standard. CAC candidates were extracted by thresholding (130 HU) and 3-D connected component analysis. They were described by shape, intensity and spatial features calculated using multi-atlas segmentation of coronary artery centerlines from ten CTA scans. CAC was identified using a randomized decision tree ensemble classifier in a ten-fold stratified cross-validation experiment and quantified in Agatston and volume scores for each patient. After classification, candidates with posterior probability indicating uncertain labeling were selected for further assessment by an expert. Images with metal implants were excluded. In the remaining 164 images, Spearman's p between automatic and reference scores was 0.94 for both Agatston and volume scores. On average 1.8 candidate lesions per scan were subsequently presented to an expert. After correction, Spearman's p was 0.98. We have described a system for automatic CAC scoring in cardiac CT images which is able to effectively select difficult examinations for further refinement by an expert. © 2014 SPIE.","Automatic coronary calcium scoring; Cardiac CT; Guided review; Randomized decision trees","Artificial intelligence; Calcium; Computer aided diagnosis; Decision trees; Electrocardiography; Heart; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Cardiac CT; Cardiovascular event; Connected component analysis; Coronary artery calciums; Coronary calcium; Independent predictors; Posterior probability; Randomized decisions; Computerized tomography","(2013) WHO Fact Sheet N317: Cardiovascular Diseases, , World Health Organization; Yeboah, J., McClelland, R.L., Polonsky, T.S., Burke, G.L., Sibley, C.T., O'Leary, D., Carr, J.J., Herrington, D.M., Comparison of novel risk markers for improvement in cardiovascular risk assessment in intermediate-risk individuals: Risk markers in cardiovascular risk assessment (2012) JAMA, 308 (8), pp. 788-795; Goff, D.C., Lloyd-Jones, D.M., Bennett, G., O'Donnell, C.J., Coady, S., Robinson, J., D'Agostino, R.B., Shero, S.T., 2013 ACC/AHA guideline on the assessment of cardiovascular risk: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines (2013) J Am Coll Cardiol; Rumberger, J.A., Brundage, B.H., Rader, D.J., Kondos, G., Electron beam computed tomographic coronary calcium scanning: A review and guidelines for use in asymptomatic persons (1999) Mayo Clin Proc, 74 (3), pp. 243-252; Isgum, I., Rutten, A., Prokop, M., Van Ginneken, B., Detection of coronary calciffcations from computed tomography scans for automated risk assessment of coronary artery disease (2007) Med Phys, 34 (4), pp. 1450-1461; Shahzad, R., Van Walsum, T., Schaap, M., Rossi, A., Klein, S., Weustink, A.C., De Feyter, P.J., Niessen, W.J., Vessel speciffc coronary artery calcium scoring: An automatic system (2013) Acad Radiol, 20 (1), pp. 1-9; Saur, S.C., Alkadhi, H., Desbiolles, L., Szekely, G., Cattin, P.C., Automatic detection of calcified coronary plaques in computed tomography data sets (2008) Proc MICCAI, pp. 170-177; Isgum, I., Prokop, M., Niemeijer, M., Viergever, M., Van Ginneken, B., Automatic coronary calcium scoring in low-dose chest computed tomography (2012) IEEE Trans Med Imaging, 31 (12), pp. 2322-2334; Klein, S., Staring, M., Murphy, K., Viergever, M.A., Pluim, J.P.W., Elastix: A toolbox for intensity-based medical image registration (2010) IEEE Trans Med Imaging, 29 (1), pp. 196-205; Langerak, T.R., Van Der Heide, U.A., Kotte, A.N., Viergever, M.A., Van Vulpen, M., Pluim, J.P., Label fusion in atlas-based segmentation using a selective and iterative method for performance level estimation (SIMPLE) (2010) IEEE Trans Med Imaging, 29 (12), pp. 2000-2008; Geurts, P., Ernst, D., Wehenkel, L., Extremely randomized trees (2006) Mach Learn, 63 (1), pp. 3-42; Fan, W., Greengrass, E., McCloskey, J., Yu, P.S., Drammey, K., Effective estimation of posterior probabilities: Explaining the accuracy of randomized decision tree approaches (2005) Proc Int IEEE Conf Data Min, 5, pp. 154-161; Saur, S.C., Alkadhi, H., Desbiolles, L., Fuchs, T.J., Székely, G., Cattin, P.C., Guided review by frequent itemset mining: Additional evidence for plaque detection (2009) Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg, 4 (3), pp. 263-271; Brunner, G., Chittajallu, D.R., Kurkure, U., Kakadiaris, I.A., Toward the automatic detection of coronary artery calciffcation in non-contrast computed tomography data (2010) Int J Cardiovasc Imaging, 26 (7), pp. 829-838; Cieslak, D.A., Hoens, T.R., Chawla, N.V., Kegelmeyer, W.P., Hellinger distance decision trees are robust and skew-insensitive (2012) Data Min Knowl Discov, 24 (1), pp. 136-158","Progr.

Further, we will assume that there is a constraint on the total number of permitted function evaluations. We introduce a Bayesian approach for this problem and show that it empirically outperforms both the existing frequentist counterpart and other Bayesian optimization methods. The Bayesian approach places emphasis on detailed modelling, including the modelling of correlations among the arms. As a result, it can perform well in situations where the number of arms is much larger than the number of allowed function evaluation, whereas the frequentist counterpart is inapplicable. This feature enables us to develop and deploy practical applications, such as automatic machine learning toolboxes.

As a consequence, such systems including, e.g., complex automatic video content analysis, are restricted to large scale applications, such as airports or train stations. In smaller settings, e.g. in shop surveillance, mostly low-cost display or record-only systems are in use. In this position paper we propose to combine two well-known approaches in order to make Intelligent Video Surveillance applicable and affordable in small to medium-scale scenarios. The proposal includes to combine the concept of Smart Cameras, i.e. cameras equipped with local processing resources, with the ideas of Cloud Computing, i.e. the on-demand provisioning of computing and storage services for complex calculations, and the management of large amounts of data, i.e. video storage. The former allows for the cost effective pre-processing of video data close to the sensor, while using the latter concept does not require large initial investments into expensive infrastructure components such as powerful compute servers. The paper presents research issues of the necessary system design, including precise system goal and system model aspects. Based on this, we discuss several research issues required to be addressed for solving the overall goals.","Automated Machine Learning; Cloud Computing; Intelligent Surveillance; Organic Computing; Smart Camera","Automated machines; Intelligent surveillance; Intelligent video surveillance; Large amounts of data; Large-scale applications; Organic computing; Smart cameras; Video-content analysis; Automation; Cameras; Cloud computing; Information science; Investments; Robotics; Video recording; Security systems","Bryant, R.E., Katz, R.H., Lazowska, E.D., Big-data computing: Creating revolutionary breakthroughs in commerce, science, and society (2008) Computing Research Initiatives for the 21st Century, , Computing Research Association; (2013) Perceptrac System Webpage, , http://www.cernium.com; Chu, M., Reich, J., Zhao, F., Distributed attention in large scale video sensor networks (2004) IEE Seminar Digests, 2004, pp. 61-65; Collins, R.T., Lipton, A.J., Fujiyoshi, H., Kanade, T., Algorithms for cooperative multisensor surveillance (2001) Surveillance, Proceedings of the IEEE; D'Angelo, D., Grenz, C., Kuntzsch, C., Bogen, M., CamInSens - An intelligent in-situ security system for public spaces (2012) Proceedings of the 2012 International Conference on Security & Management (SAM), , 2012, 16.-19.

This short paper highlights the use of recent work in machine learning to entirely automate the machine learning pipeline, from feature extraction to classification. A nonparametrically guided autoencoder is used to extract features and perform classification while Bayesian optimization is used to automatically tune the parameters of the model for best performance. Empirical analysis is performed on a real-world rehabilitation research problem. The entirely automated approach significantly outperforms previously published results using carefully tuned machine learning algorithms on the same data.

CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has become the reference standard for PE diagnosis, but the interpretation of these large image datasets is made complex and time consuming by the intricate branching structure of the pulmonary vessels, a myriad of artifacts that may obscure or mimic PEs, and suboptimal bolus of contrast and inhomogeneities with the pulmonary arterial blood pool. To meet this challenge, several approaches for computer aided diagnosis of PE in CTPA have been proposed. However, none of these approaches is capable of detecting central PEs, distinguishing the pulmonary artery from the vein to effectively remove any false positives from the veins, and dynamically adapting to suboptimal contrast conditions associated the CTPA scans. To overcome these shortcomings, it requires highly efficient and accurate identification of the pulmonary trunk. For this very purpose, in this paper, we present a machine learning based approach for automatically detecting the pulmonary trunk. Our idea is to train a cascaded AdaBoost classifier with a large number of Haar features extracted from CTPA image samples, so that the pulmonary trunk can be automatically identified by sequentially scanning the CTPA images and classifying each encountered sub-image with the trained classifier. Our approach outperforms an existing anatomy-based approach, requiring no explicit representation of anatomical knowledge and achieving a nearly 100% accuracy tested on a large number of cases. © 2011 SPIE.","AdaBoost; Automatic machine learning based detection; Cascade; Haar; Pulmonary Embolism; Pulmonary Trunk","AdaBoost; Automatic machine learning based detection; Cascade; Haar; Pulmonary embolism; Pulmonary Trunk; Adaptive boosting; Blood vessels; Computer aided diagnosis; Computer aided instruction; Diseases; Extraction; Knowledge representation; Lakes; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Computerized tomography","(2008) The Surgeon General's Call to Action to Prevent Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism, , US Department of Health and Human Services; Bouma, H., Automatic detection of pulmonary embolism in CTA images (2009) IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 28, pp. 1223-1230. , Aug; Zhou, C., Automatic pulmonary vessel segmentation in 3D computed tomographic pulmonary angiographic (CTPA) images (2006) Proceedings of SPIE, pp. 61444Q-61444Q7. , San Diego, CA, USA; Liang, J., Bi, J., Computer aided detection of pulmonary embolism with tobogganing and multiple instance classification in CT pulmonary angiography (2007) Information Processing in Medical Imaging, 20, pp. 630-641; Sebbe, R., (2007) Computer-aided Diagnosis of Pulmonary Embolism in Opacified CT Images, , PhD thesis, Faculte Polytechnique de Mons, Feb; Masutani, Y., MacMahon, H., Doi, K., Computerized detection of pulmonary embolism in spiral CT angiography based on volumetric image analysis (2002) IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 21, pp. 1517-1523. , Dec; Bouma, H., (2008) Vessel-Diameter Quantification and Embolus Detection in CTA Images, , PhD.

A few such systems are available for documents written in English. In this paper, we propose a model called LEH_KEY (Learning to Extract Hebrew KEYphrases) that for the first time learns to extract keyphrases for documents written in Hebrew. Firstly, we introduce a relatively high number (15) of baseline extraction methods as opposed to other related systems that use combinations of a low number (two/three) of baseline extraction methods. In contrast, we have investigated various combinations of larger number of baseline methods and various machine learning methods have been tested. The best results have been achieved by a combination of six baseline methods using J48 (an improved variant of C4.5). Our results have been found to be at least of equal quality to those achieved by extraction systems for documents written in English, which are regarded as state-of-the art.",,"HTML; Information retrieval; Information retrieval systems; Linguistics; Automatic machine learning; Baseline extraction methods; Machine learning methods; Learning systems","Alterman, R., Text summarization (1992) Encyclopedia of artificial intelligence, pp. 1579-1587. , edited by S.

We analyzed the image scanning method affect to the polynomial-approach method. Furthermore, we also researched the way of accumulation that can make the violent wobble of the curve became more gentle. Finally, We propose an approach, which has three steps: raster scanning of the image data, monotonizing data according to self-adapt parameter choice and polynomial-approach. This method achieved the image compression coding successfully. Experiments on traffic images snowed our method is simple and high efficiency. It is high performance on the small complex traffic image, especially in middle and low signal-to-noise ratio. © 2006 IEEE.","Automatic machine learning; Image scanning; ITS; Polynomial-approach; Traffic image compression","Data reduction; Image analysis; Parameter estimation; Polynomials; Signal to noise ratio; Traffic congestion; Automatic machine learning; Image scanning; Traffic image compression; Image compression","CAO Kui.

We suggest that a global search algorithm may avoid this. This method defines sets of mutually exclusive candidate features of the model. Each set constitutes a dimension of a discrete search space. The current example uses Genetic Algorithm (GA) to search this space. A simulated data set was created. An 11 dimension search space was defined, consisting of # of compartments, various inter and intra individual errors, lag time, covariate relationships and all possible diagonal and non-diagonal OMEGA matrices. The ""fitness"" of the models is a modified Akaike information criteria. An exhaustive search of the candidate models (n=12,288) was compared to the results using GA. Shown is a histogram of the fitness of all candidate models. GA selected the optimal model (fitness=953.48) from this candidate model space after examining 153 unique models. GA may provide a robust, efficient prospective, and objective method for model selection using NONMEM. (Figure Presented).",,,,"Clin. Pharmacol. Ther.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33748972444

This article presents variation of first order line search optimization techniques that has superlinear convergence rates, i.e. the fastest convergence rates for first order methods. The presented algorithm has substantially simplified a line search subproblem into a single step calculation of the appropriate values of step length and/or momentum term. This remarkably simplifies the implementation and computational complexity of the line search subproblem and yet does not harm the stability of the methods. The algorithm is theoretically proven to be convergent, with superlinear convergence rates, and exactly classified within the newly proposed clarification framework for first order techniques. Performance of the proposed algorithm is practically evaluated on five data sets and compared to the relevant standard first order optimization techniques. The results indicate superior performance of the presented algorithm over the standard first order methods.",,"Computational complexity; Convergence of numerical methods; Learning algorithms; Optimization; Conjugate gradients; First order line search optimization; Steepest descent method; Learning systems",,"IEEE Int Conf Neural Networks Conf Proc",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031642596
